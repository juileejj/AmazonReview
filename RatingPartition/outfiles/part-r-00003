It's bigger than you'd think from the picture - it'll hold most currencies without folding, so everything is nice and flat. There are four pockets that are as big as the entire wallet. I was kind of hoping for a card-sized pocket (for ID), but no. However, since there are two pockets accessed from the top (under the Velcro-closing flap), and two pockets accessed from zippers on either side, you have options on what to put where. Think about where you want to put things, and you should be able to pull this out, get what you need, and put it back under your shirt pretty quickly.So, I recommend this as a cheap, simple way of carrying things with some security, but keep in mind that it isn't perfect.

My only other complaint is that the pocket closure is velcro so it is really noisy when you are trying to \"quietly\" take out money or credit cards.  I'd rather not call attention to the fact that I have a hidden pouch.  I wish it had a top zipper instead.  I'm thinking of taking off the velcro and putting a button or snap closure on it instead.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2011", "summary": "Sturdy Little Travel Pouch"}

I used to have Creative Nomad II.  It was excellent to be honest.  It had FM Radio, Voice recorder and MP3.  As I used it more often, I was frustrated with the memory size and how much memory cost if you want more.  Jukebox.  It's no problem.  Right now, I have 300 individual MP3 songs in there.  It plays great and it sounds even better since this unit includes EAX.  Preset EQ such as Stadium sound, Concert hall, and so on.  Nomad II didn't have this before, so it made a huge difference in listening quality.  I really love this player.  I also found some problems with the player.  It has a better software that handles MP3 Creative PlayCenter 2. But, its interface is a bit ... not intuitive.  There are two screens to juggle.  There is also no way to manage new MP3 songs from the old ones already inside your player.  What I mean is when you only want to add a new song, you either have to remember the new songs or create a new folder and put all the new songs in there.  The other thing is that you can not download songs from the player.  I think you can only upload it if I am correct.(I maybe wrong.)  Jukebox also uses USB to connect to your computer.  It's fast, but occasionally it fails when you try to upload a lot of songs.  It's not that big a problem, but the thing is that you don't know where you were dropped, so you have to figure out what songs were trasferred and not transferred.  Jukebox, by the way,uses its own OS.  When you try to do many things fast, it can crash.  There is a reset button.  It won't erase anything, but you need a very long needle like pin to reset it, but it wasn't supplied by the Creative, so when your jukebox crashes when you are on the road, you better have something sharp.  Otherwise, you won't be able to use it.  OS is also a bit ... again, not intuitive.  It's a bit harder to navigate through the menu, and if you want to erase a song, there is no erase button like Nomad II, but instead, you will have to go through series of menu, then you will have to go back to the playlist to start playing again.  Despite all these things, I still love this machine.  To me, memory count a lot more than some system glitches.  Only thing I hope is a remote.  Possibly wireless remote.  Jukebox has a Infrared interface beside the USB.  So, there is some possibility that Creative will release it.  If you don't carry around the unit often, this will help accessing songs from your couch.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2000", "summary": "Excellent solution for Napster fan, but need improvements"}

When I went to buy, it was total impulse, money to burn, buy it. I took a chance on the Nomad because of size alone. Don't kid yourself, size is everything. When it comes to MP3 files, most companies out there don't seem to get the fact that anyone interested in MP3's need a LOT of space. This puppy has it. My entire collection is only 4 gigs, and I have a LOT of music.The sound is a little light. I bought better headphones than the ones included (didn't like the fit of those anyway) and now have a classic over the head set that is fine. Still could be louder, but as it is, people sitting next to me on the train can hear what I am listening to. So it plays fine.The error handling on the Nomad is a bit weak. It has no way to deal with corrupt files, and sometimes I get a load of new music and don't have time to listen to all the tracks and make sure they are full and complete before I am on my way out the door. So I have had to pull the batteries out just to reboot. It will totally freeze up when it hits a bad file. No way around it but to reboot, and the start up time is a bit on the long side.The battery life has been mentioned, but since my biggest use is between the house and the office, I just plug it in when I get to either, and it's ready for the ride back.These are seriously the ONLY complaints I can come up with. I ended up replacing the carry bag with a regular CD Player/CD case with a shoulder strap and enough space to keep the recharge cord with me. It's no havier than a CD player, I don't have to worry about skipping music if I move, and I have my entire music collection on my hip. That makes the good out weight the bad by a long shot.

Most of these drawbacks have been noted by other reviewers, but a couple of them really need to be carefully considered by any prospective purchaser.Positives are many and widely noted already.  Capacity is very good a 6GB - but by no means limitless as some reviews claim.  If you are a big music buff who likes a lot of variety in the music at hand, you can fill this baby up as I have.  However, it beats every other alternative I've found and sure beats carrying 30 or 40 CDs on every business trip.  Sound is good.  Latest firmware upgrade solves a number of niggling ease-of-use issues.There are really only a couple of negatives, but they may be severe depending on what's driving your purchase.  First, assume you will need to pitch the headphones that come with the unit and replace them with something else.  Personally, I've used it with both Sony and Bose noise cancelling headphones and either, esp. the Bose, works great in combo with the Jukebox.  If you are an airplane traveller, this is the way to go.However, if you are an airplane listener, you run into the big drawback on this unit way too fast - battery life is ridiculously low.  I do a lot of transcontinental flying and go from LA to Europe about once a month.  My original reason for getting the unit was to save carrying CD player plus 2 or 3 dozen CDs all over Europe just for those 10 to 12 hour flights.  But even with two sets of the rechargable batteries, I can't even get half-way to Europe.  So I've really been unable to satisfy my original purpose in buying the unit.  It has been great in my office, where I can plug it in to electricity, playing out through a Bose Wave Radio and its fine on shorter flights.Overall a super device except for the crippling short life of its batteries.

I've gone through my share of MP3 players, minidisc players, walkmans and discmans, but so far nothing has had the versatility that the Nomad Jukebox has. My problem is that whenever I travel I insist that I can't survive without bringing my entire CD collection, and it's annoying (and risky) to lug around that many CDs. Minidiscs provided a solution for a while, but it was to much hassle to spend so much time recording &amp; editing the minidiscs manually without the help of a computer program. MP3 players like the Rio 500 &amp; Nomad II are great for day use &amp; jogging, but most of the time 1 hour just doesn't cut it. MP3-CD players don't seem worth it to me because you still have to buy a CD burner &amp; carry around CDs. The Nomad Jukebox is for people who want a MASSIVE amount of music (6 GIGs, 100+ hours, which is 100x more than most Mp3 players, at around the same price) for use over a long period of time or at home.The Jukebox comes bundled with software for PlayCenter 2 (for the PC) or SoundJam (for Macs) to use for ripping CDs &amp; Mp3s from your computer to the Jukebox. It also comes with decent headphones (loudness is NOT a problem) &amp; a carrying case, plus all the necessary equipment for setting it up. Setup is pretty easy, and using the software is a lot more intuitive than I though it would be. It takes me around 5 minutes to rip a CD from my computer the the Nomad. The best feature by far is the OMD description searcher-- if you're online while your ripping CDs, the OMD finds the album name, year released, genre, artist, &amp; ALL the track names, so you don't have to type anything in. You can also rip Mp3s from the Nomad back to your computer. The songs in the Nomad can be categorized under Albums, Artists, Genres or Play Lists to make it easier to navigate. It supports data, mp3, wma, and wav files (plus many others). You can download updates [from the web] for better software or firmware for the player, so even if something isn't perfect now, in the future improvements will be available. The player also has an infrared port on the front for future additions (like a remote control). It comes with 2 hours of free music (mostly classical) and some Audio Books. It includes jacks for line-in recording from radios, microphones or stereos,  and line-out hookup to stereos or speakers.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox is a very new kind of Mp3 player, so it has a few MAJOR flaws:1) BATTERY POWER- Hard Drives tend to suck up an endless amount of power, and that's exactly what the Jukebox is-- a Hard Drive disguised as an Mp3 player. You can ONLY use the 4 rechargeable batteries that Nomad gives you (AA size) to run it without the AC adapter, and those only last around 2 hours by themselves. Nomad includes an extra set of 4 to replace them, but you always have to make sure they are fully charged. Maybe in the future there will be more options (battery pack?)2) WEIGHT - It's around the size of a first-generation CD player, and it weighs around 2 lbs with batteries. This isn't really a problem for me, but it depends what you want to use it for. It's not meant for use while jogging or biking, etc-- it's more for use over a long period of time away from home, on the bus/plane/dorm/in the car, or at home, plugged into the AC adapter and a pair of speakers. Besides the weight, in my opinion, it looks VERY nice- it has unique, smooth design, coloring and shape (and the LCD screen is easy to read).The Nomad Jukebox is the best in its category of high-capacity Mp3 players-- It holds 100 times more music than a normal Mp3 player, and its price has been drastically reduced, making it a lot more affordable than it was before. Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It is the best option for anyone who's ever wished they could bring all their CDs with them without actually having to CARRY them... and I think that I will be using it for a long, long time from now.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2001", "summary": "Nomad Jukebox - the best Mp3 player as of now..."}

As for the problems experienced in ripping and loading from the PC. Personally I use MusicMatch Juke box to rip, organize and play music on my PC so the files are already ripped and categorized etc by the CDDB system. This makes it very easy to transfer music to the Jukebox as the Playcenter software which comes with it enables you to locate the folders/files on your PC and just load them across to your Jukebox, this I have found to be very quick, and on the occassion that I did find one corrupt file is was to do with the original ripping and not the transfer. It is a great means to move and listen to a lot of music, its not a put in your pocket whist you jog player.

Charging the batteries up for the Jukebox is a royal pain since after the batteries are at 100% it will then start draining them for another charge.  Speaking about battries be VERY careful when inserting them.  The polarites (where the positve and negative go) are very weird so use caution.  I also have a great deal of problems putting WAV's onto the player.  I have to convert most of them to MP3's first and then play them or else I get goobldy gook.However, the Jukebox is the biggest MP3 player available.  Navigation is remarkably easy (turn off Novice mode the second you get it).  The USB connection works super fast and an average MP3 will be on the player in less then 4 seconds.  The bundled software for PC is excellent and is also very useful just for ripping MP3's.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2000", "summary": "A Great MP3 Player With a Few Glitches"}

I get better .wma sound using Windows Media Player, but again that goes to the hard drive then to the Jukebox.i also can't figure out how to trasnfer from the Jukebox to a PC.  The Jukebox comes with a couple audio books that I would like to put onto PC and make room on the Nomad for more music.Overall the next version of the Jukebox should be great.  It needs a bigger drive, maybe 20 gig.  It also could use a tuner for FM signals to make it more of a complete product.  I would also love to see a digital out to plug into a good quality stereo.  I would say people should hold off buying until the next gen of players are on the market.

And, with only one significant, and one minor exception, my initial view is very favorable.  With luck, I'll remember to update this review after a few months use.The satchel appears to be well stitched together of durable canvas.  Its handsome but rugged appearance seems right for the task.  There's no inherent stiffness or padding, but my use includes carrying a couple of clipboards which resolves that issue.I have a feeling this case will hold up well for a number of years.  It's already very comfortable to carry and to use.Some reviewers have lamented the non-adjustable shoulder strap.  Since I won't use the shoulder strap often, it's a non-issue.  An aftermarket adjustable strap could be snapped into place easily.Several reviewers have commented negatively on the red and white oval BucketBoss name tag.  The name tag's shiny plastic texture and its brilliant red and white colors are way wrong.  Anyone who routinely carries a combination tool and document briefcase is most likely not trying to make a fashion statement, but this name tag just doesn't belong.Well, no problem.  It's attached by a single row of stitching around the edge.  I grasped an edge with needle nose pliers and carefully cut a stitch with a razor knife.  Then I was able to pull it away with fingers and continue slicing the stitches.  Took less time than you've spent reading this.  Looks just right without it.  A cloth logo in the proper colors would have worked well here, but it's perfectly fine without any logo.The one significant problem with the satchel is one that I saw clearly from the photos on Amazon's site and others, so it was no surprise.  I purchased anyway, intending to either live with it or to kludge a workaround.  That problem is that the \"Business Side\" and the \"Tool Side\" are reversed.The \"Tool Side\" features two rows of narrow stitched pockets intended for small hand tools.  Nicely done, but these tools need to be quickly accesible, and preferably with the satchel standing upright.  The \"Tool Side\" therefore could be better utilized under the flap.The \"Business Side\" is used for stowing file folders and documents which might benefit from a slightly greater bit of security.  The \"Business Side\" then would have been better placed in the zippered section.  To some this may seem a quibble.  Depends on your particular work situation, I suppose.  For me the reversal would have been far better.Still, I bought it, and I like it.  I looked around quite a bit and could find nothing else that fit the bill as well.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2012", "summary": "Now, better than new..."}

Two are covered by a single flap-over cover and one has zipper.  Plenty of practical pockets and compartments.  The zippered compartment has its own set of pockets and can hold folders/pads.  With the zipper shut, the case can be upside down and nothing can fall out.  Good quality zipper, snap buckles, and other hardware.  All works very well.  Very good design and construction, high-quality rugged fabric, heavy stitching and hems.  Also, the fabric is pliable and not stiff as one might expect at first sight.The only drawbacks are the non-adjustable shoulder strap and it is on the small side for some users.  Several standard pads and folders will fit in each compartment.  I do not carry a lap top in it, but I think the smaller ones will fit. For me, the size is perfect.The color is brownish green and has a good finish. Looks good for what it is.Almost perfect.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only due to non-adjustable strap, though it doesn't bother me.You cannot lose with this one.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2011", "summary": "Excellent briefcase for field work, great value and quality"}

Second week of October I was looking for the Woddy costume at the Disney store and it was great, very nicely made, but they didn't have my son's size any more, not even available for them to order it.  So I went online and found this one.  It is ok, but not great.  Basically all one piece and looks kind of cheapy.  On the plus side the fabric is comfortable (soft) and not overly hot if you live in a warmer climate.  The boots are a joke, you're better off getting your own or if your child has brown shoes it works too.  My 2 year old loved it and wanted it to wear it all the time, so for what it's worth I got from it what I wanted.  Surprisingly it did well for a long time with the washes.  Towards the end he started looking like a cowboy going through rough times but the costume held up to the washing machine better than I would have thought.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2013", "summary": "It's ok but the one from the Disney store is better"}

I emailed the company (Costume Hub) to tell them, also explaining we needed it for the coming weekend (Oct 23rd) and they took a few days before they sent an email saying they would send a replacement one. Well the correct costume did not come until today (Monday Oct 25th) but I just used the too large costume for this weekend, as we needed it and the correct size did not arrive until too late.I do appreciate Costume Hub sending a new one, although it didn't reach us quite in time.

He ran around a lot but it didn't tear at all. I think it has a couple more good uses in it.If you are hoping to buy a costume that will last and will allow your child to play in it at home, I don't think this is the one. They have the $50 one that looks a lot more sturdier. But if it's just for this Halloween and maybe next year for the kiddo next door, then by all means, get this one!!!

This makes it a little bit awkward to get into, and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom. To use the bathroom, you have to take off the whole top of the costume, and then hold onto it so it doesn't touch a dirty bathroom floor (I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom).

For some reason I decided I needed a Stormtrooper helmet to wear with my Utilikilt. I know... an odd combination to some, but makes perfect sense to me. I started looking for helmets here on Amazon and found the one I wanted. Only problem was it costs $150. I actually put it in my wish list to ponder whether I'd be willing to part with $150 for something that I wasn't going to wear that often. Finally decided to go with the economy version and bought this one.First, as others have pointed out, the helmet that ships isn't the one in the photo. The black perforated eye areas actually have smoked gray plastic lenses (thankfully). Most everything else seems to be pretty accurate. Also, as others have pointed out, the helmet is in 4 pieces that don't stay together very well. You'll want some krazy glue or duct tape to make sure you're not fighting with it if you drop it or are a little rough on it. Even when it's put together I can see a bit of a gap on the seam that runs across the top. Not a huge deal as most people won't be able to see it, but it's there.I'd still like to have one of the better helmets, but until somebody smacks me on the bum with a golden spoon I'll settle for the $22 version. BTW, I also ordered a Stormtrooper white t-shirt (that looks like the torso of the stormtrooper armor) to wear with it. Found it here on Amazon as well for about $20.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2012", "summary": "Economical option"}

(The straps aren't padded, but somehow they seem to work just fine.) It is also slightly more staid-looking than the picture would lead you to believe. The bag seems durable, but I wouldn't predict more than a 3-5 year lifespan.

Van Der Hoorn", "helpful": [11, 11], "unixReviewTime": 1125100800, "reviewText": "I have the watch for 3 years now, and am very satisfied. It was quite a challenge though to get the 'lunitidal interval' value needed to display the correct tidal data. The manual lists the required numbers for several cities around the world, but tidal dynamics are extremely complicated and tides can differ several hours even when you go up north or south of the same coast. What made it more complicated, was that I am living in a country where English is not the main language, and I had no idea what I was looking for in local terms. Finally, I understood that lunitidal interval is known here as \"gemiddeld havengetal\" (Dutch), but still it was a real challenge to find it for the spot of coast I was planning to use the watch. It was not on the internet - ultimaltely I was able to find it in a specialized yearly nautical publication. I can imagine that not being able to find the right data, might let some users down. Casio should have realized this and should have put more effort into guiding the user to the right values. It might be the reason Casio left this option out of the newer Sea-Patchfinder models. For users in The Netherlands: I have uploaded a table at [...]As far as the watch: one problem I have with it, is that it does not have dual time, which I really need. Second, I do not understand why Casio has chosen not to print a complete 360 degree scale around the watch, but chose to print COMP, BARO and START in between the 210 and 330 degree values instead. Especially since it is also shown near the buttons as well as on the display at about the same spot. OK, it is nice to have a compass and a barometre, but don't need to read THREE times every time I look at my watch. Another disadvantage is that it is impossible to verify that the watch is level when using the compass. Especially at sea, this is essential. The watch does have some sort of tilt sensor to automatically switch on the light when you look at your wrist - it would have been nice if this feature had been used to indicate if the watch was level.A small disadvantage is the short lighting period. Having so many batteries aboard, this period could have been longer than 1.5 seconds. Also, it would have been nice if the moon graph was inverted - with the positive display showing the lighted part of the moon. Standing outside in the dark and pressing the light switch, results in seeing the dark part of the moon lighted up on your watch... Also, a button lock would have been nice. Because of its size, it is easy to press a button by mistake. Especially the Baro-button is prone to be pressed inadvertially when bending your wrist, supporting yourself during an activity.Otherwise, a perfect watch, which is extremely light for its size. The distinct beep when you return to time mode, is very handy. The glass does not scratch, it is perfectly protected by the bezel ring. I am looking for a replacement after 3 years, since the black plastic light switch broke off (it is only supported at the back by a small metal pin which is off-center, so pressing it eventually makes the connection snap) and the barometric pressure sensor went offline recently. Since I really need dual time and I do not like the newer Pathfinder model using about 1/4 of the display telling me about the battery status (what a waste of space!), I decided to compromise the tidal data and buy a Suunto watch (with button lock and sensor that indicates if the compass is level) next.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2005", "summary": "Tidal data not that easy to adjustl"}

First, since the program is a full emersion program, while I am picking up on words and associations, I often find myself not understanding the entire phrase of what is being said. I wish there was an option to show the statements in English to just confirm what I thought was just shown to me.The other problem, however, I find worse. The microphone that comes with the program is terrible. First off, unless I'm doing something wrong the headset speakers doesn't work. All my sound came out of my computer speakers. Even more frustrating is that the mic rarely picks up what I am saying. I find myself saying phrases and words several times before the program acknowledges it. Then, it often doesn't register exactly what I said. I know Vietnamese is a tonal language, but I say the same thing without changing the pronunciation multiple times before the program says I'm correct. If I was pronouncing it wrong, then it should never say I did it correctly. If you're getting this program and your computer doesn't have a built in mic, I'd recommend buying one outside what comes in the box.In all, the program is great and I'm already starting to feel confident speaking to my girlfriend's family (who are Vietnamese) but I am not completely confident to carry entire conversations.

Having said that, my preferences lean towards product that aid in increasing my confidence in speaking, reading, writing, and understanding. Generally, these programs have clear audio, pictures, simple grammar lessons, and clear breakdowns of phonetic structures for non-native speakers (being entertaining and cheap is always a plus!)Rosetta Stone is a wonderful vocabulary builder. The pictures and audio help store new words in long-term memory. The games *can* be fun and the lessons test listening skills and adaptive recall. With purchase, a user gains access to online tutoring sessions with a native speaker after completing chapter units (to try out their new skills.) Listening to the natural rhythm of native speakers in the program helps reduce accent and familiarize a user with the new language. There is a lot of content in level 1 of Japanese alone, which is broken into 4 units: Language Basics, Greeting/Introductions, Work/School, and Shopping. Each lesson builds on the last, helping the user retain vocabulary previously studied (but sadly, nearly prohibiting skipping ahead).Unfortunately, there are some major flaws:This isn't the fastest self-taught curriculum; you won't learn useful, everyday phrases right away. Sure, I understand \"The cat is sleeping.\" Or, \"The boy runs.\" That's good, but how am I to realistically apply this to practical conversation? It took hours of lessons to learn phrases like \"goodnight,\" or \"Where is the bathroom?\"Grammar is never fully broken down. Users are left guessing how or why sentence structure or the Japanese particle system works (if they can even figure out what that is). Vocabulary, even with the pictures, is also vague at times. A child learning a new language uses a lot of guess work and is constantly corrected by parents in the early stages of language development. An adult, however, shouldn't need to make nearly as many mistakes as a babbling toddler, let alone without being constantly corrected. When confused about a word or phrase meaning, there is no direct translation available through Rosetta Stone itself- ever. I shouldn't need to use Google Translate to understand what I'm learning. It can be frustrating for absolute beginners. The phrases, when repeated listen for accuracy in the user's speech. However, one must only be about 80% correct for a sentence to register as right. I tested by saying and omitting words at times, and skimmed through the lesson with few problems. It's not that it's not okay to make mistake while learning, but proceed with caution. The words pop up as the user speaks them. Parts of a sentence that do not register as clear will appear in a more faded font. There were times when I spoke correctly, and still read faded font, second-guessing myself. (Though my sensei confirmed I was correct!)Lastly, despite having lots of content, the lessons can be insanely repetitive and even confusing at times. It's easy for beginners to get disheartened, or think that language isn't their niche due to a poor start with the wrong learning materials. Conversational Japanese is actually the easiest self-taught language I've studied, with consistent sentence structures and easily approachable sounds for native English and Spanish speakers.I used Rosetta Stone as a vocabulary builder along with my college JPN 103 class. I got what I paid for: increased confidence, greater fluency, and larger vocabulary. The catch is that I already mostly understood what and why words were ordered in each set. I recommend Rosetta Stone for people with some basic knowledge of Japanese language looking to build on what they already know, but definitely not for a novice. For the money, I can see how this would be an overwhelming frustrating disappointment. Invest in something with audio and a simple grammar book, some hiragana/katakana workbooks, and flashcards.

I can't say all of this was from Rosetta Stone, though. I thought Rosetta Stone was pretty good, but I don't think I could call it a standalone resource to learn Japanese. A major part of learning Japanese is mastering the katakana, hiragana, and kanji, and Rosetta Stone is definitely not the best way to do that. There's a section of the program that teaches katakana and hiragana, but I feel that Rosetta Stone has a pretty inefficient way of teaching the alphabet.I really liked Rosetta Stone's voice recognition. Not many other programs offer that. I had to turn up the speech precision difficulty though because I thought it was being too lenient on pronunciation. I definitely did not like the milestones at the end of each unit, which expect the user to speak his/her way through a \"real life\" situation. The problem is that even though language is dynamic and diverse, Rosetta Stone says there's a single specific response for everything, and it's not easy at all to guess this from the context.Rosetta Stone was great for teaching vocabulary, and I've retained most of what I've learned from it. To fill the shortcomings of Rosetta Stone, I've been using some other resources which I'll list here.Human Japanese: For the money, this teaches much more than Rosetta Stone can. It covers the alphabet, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural notes and it's a really interesting read.GENKI I: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese [With CDROM] (Japanese Edition) (English and Japanese Edition): I'm only a few chapters into Genki, but it's known as one of the best \"real\" textbooks for self study.Remembering the Kana: A Guide to Reading and Writing the Japanese Syllabaries in 3 Hours Each (part 1) (Japanese Edition): Dr. Heisig's Remembering the Kana was the quickest, most efficient way I could find to learn the kana.Remembering the Kanji: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters: Heisig's Remembering the Kanji has taught me several hundred kanji so far, and I still remember the ones I learned almost a year ago.I liked Rosetta Stone a lot, but it's too expensive for what it gives. For the same price as a single Rosetta Stone level, you could buy a much more diverse set of resources and learn a lot more. If money isn't an issue though, go for it.

I previously already knew some Japanese before starting this program but it was very broken and limited Japanese. I truly feel that if i keep at it with lessons i will be able to master this language within 4 years. That's about the time i have heard other people who have mastered the language say it took them in classes. I love the program and will be getting Italian next. Although, i already know broken and limited Italian as well. The Italian will be easier for me to learn i suspect. Its just a easier language to learn compared to Japanese. With how much Japanese i learned with the program in just 2 days of lessons, i suspect that i will master Italian in about 2 years. It's a good program and i am very happy with it. This method may not be for everyone. I am more of a visual learner and have photographic memory so maybe that is why i was able to pick up so much in just 2 days. To Visual learner's YES i do recommend this program.I do each lesson 5 times a day. I am already on core lesson 2. My ending score for core lesson 1 is about 98% in 2 days. What is in that lesson, i honestly did not know before i started the program. So before you buy this program you need to decide if your an audio or visual learner first. I do honestly feel that i will be able to learn at least half of any language that i plan to learn with Rosetta Stone. Thank you Rosetta Stone for making it easier and most importantly more FUN!This program does require you to think and remember. It won't do the memorizing and thinking for you. The writing part is difficult though and i think its more of a program to teach you to understand Japanese when spoken to you.

This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run across and even with brief usage, has yielded great results.  Although I have no major complaints with the program itself, the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues with installing the software, I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed.  For example, Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language software to work properly and Vista needs SP2.  It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems.  If you have an older pc, you really need to check the hardware requirements.  Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start booklet, installation cds, software cds, headset, user agreement booklet, keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services.  The quick start guide is important to read first and provides support online or by telephone (called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze).  The software installed easily on Windows 7 as did the included headset via usb port.  The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it. The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic.  I had an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software.  I don't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal.  I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation (the headset has a microphone), builds vocabulary and phrases, and teaches simple conversation.  The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering: basics (unit 1), greetings and introduction (unit 2), work and school (unit 3) and shopping (unit 4).  Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone's online services is required. Although the box states it includes free online features, they are free for three months only.  There is a $25 monthly fee  or a $149 fee for 15 months for online services after the trial period.  The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account.  I strongly suggest you use the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software.  The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors, games, and an online community to practice your Italian.  I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons to get more out of it.  It's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall, this is a great tool to learn Italian if you can afford the hefty price tag.  For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more convenient and provides more personalized service.  Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost.  I don't think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian, this would be worth the price.  I consider having friendly customer service available by phone a big plus.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2011", "summary": "a great way to learn italian if you can afford it"}

They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language.  I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent.  Level One for me, is just right.  However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian.  I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language.  Also, I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes.  I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the program itself.  After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied.  I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language.  Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2011", "summary": "Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1"}

The included instructions are simple and straightforward. Activation required 2 tries, but it appears the code is only valid for 3 months so I suspect online access may be terminated after 3 months but the software should still continue to work.The pace starts off slow, but within the early portion of Unit 1, the vocabulary starts to pick up rather quickly. Since I am not a language expert, I had a hard time keeping up initially because different tenses of words, or the plural, were thrown in. Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out, which is quite useful but I could not get a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech. Once you start getting used to the phrases, the software begins to kick it up by throwing in more words. Unfortunately, like other users, the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition. This helps with pronunciation, although I found that it will disable my main audio and I have to switch back and forth. This isn't a big deal for most people, and there's no easy workaround.The box advertises that many Government agencies use Rosetta Stone, like the US Army and State Department. There certainly is value in the Rosetta Stone software helping Soldiers or agents learn a foreign language in the shortest time possible, but I felt it should focus on more useful phrases. 45 minutes of repeating various forms of \"Boys eating\", or \"girls running\" are not phrases that have much tactical value when you're visiting or operating in a different country.Overall: 4/5 stars", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2011", "summary": "Easy to use, but the phrases need to be more useful"}

In particular this is the case with pronunciation, as it's difficult to ensure you're saying things properly.  The Rosetta stone format helps immensely with this is as it provides active feedback with its microphone and headset.  I found this an important aspect because it keeps me motivated to continue practicing day in and out AND I'm ensured my practicing is proper.  Without active feedback, it's like learning to play a musical instrument without having anyone listen to you play - you may THINK you're playing well but really, you aren't, so the first time you try to perform, you'll get a lot of strange looks.  No different here.Downsides?  Need some fairly decent computing power to get this running.  I wouldn't touch it on anything less than a modern dual core.The level 1 is far too basic for anyone to just stop there.  One needs to continue onwards to at least level 5 to gain any noticeable appreciation in skills.  I know most will shy away from the higher levels because they cost so much.  It's hard for most people to push the button for a $400 software package these days.  Then again, you need to compare to getting professional lessons which will definitely cost you more.

I am hearing stories from other homeschoolers who have used RS for multiple years and who were happy with RS, that they are too lacking in grammar to perform well on the SAT II test (the SAT subject test is now required by some colleges for admission), so they are suddenly unhappy with RS but it's too late to do anything about it. I want to learn from those people's mistakes! If you desire a stronger grammar component, before buying RS you should look into a newer productFluenz Italian 1 with supplemental Audio CD and Podcastswhich seems just like RS but with more grammar (and is similarly priced).Also if you are a homeschooling parent you should know there is a \"RSFluenz Italian 1+2 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcastshomeschool package\" (see the RS website for info), which may be better than this `standard' product for your homeschool.--RS was easy to install, we had no problem getting it started on our Windows PC. There was some confusion over activating the online account, which is free for 90 days only, which we wound up not using anyway, as the base lessons were enough. We misunderstood the directions and thought we HAD to register online to start using it, but that doesn't seem to be correct.To test RS I used it, as did both of my homeschooled kids (aged 10 and 13). The only system glitch we have sometimes was the headset would not activate sometimes, when switching between users who attempt to use RS right after someone else used it. The fix that works is rebooting the PC.The program prompts the user to speak into the headset and it checks the accuracy. One of my kids (a newbie to learning foreign language) seems to have a problem and he blames the headset or the program for hearing him wrong but in RS's defense when I listen to the sample and then what my son is saying I detect a minor intonation error on my son's part or the emphasis part of the word is not being emphasized strongly enough, so the problem is my SON not the system. My other son has this problem once in a while only. I have not experienced this myself as after years of taking French in public school and college I have trained my ear to listen very carefully and also keep telling myself to not use Standard English speaking patterns (my son keeps overriding the Italian and inserting a more English language sound). I keep emphasizing to my sons to watch the voice recognition graph so they can see where there is a problem (it's a pretty cool feature). I mention this as perhaps other users may have this issue and might think the voice recognition software is faulty when really it is the user!This product is marketed to adults not just children. As an adult learner who formerly learned in a very different way this RS method of learning felt odd to me. I wanted to see things written out that I could look at (I'm a strong visual-text learner). Don't laugh but it took me a while to figure out what I was saying, not realizing for example that in Italian there is a pronoun for multiple females as \"they\". It was a bit odd to jump right in learning multiple pronouns that we don't use in English and also to use the verb conjugations without seeing anything in writing to explain it. I was having memory flashbacks of my school's French textbook that had the nice list of conjugations so I could read it written out while I was reciting it orally to help cement it in my mind. This way of learning the pronoun and verb when looking at just a color photo of the scene being referenced is so different for me, however it appeals to people who have a stronger sense of visual-image learning or for auditory learners. I still feel I need some kind of rule list to see in front of me, I found it hard to both learn the content and think to try to figure out the rules myself right in the middle of the lessons. For example, there is no direct teaching of which noun is feminine versus masculine and how that affects both the ending of the noun and the choice of verb to use with it. I had to figure out that `a' at the end is typically feminine and that `o' is typically masculine. I only knew about the existence of gender differences for non-living things from my former French classes; to my English speaking kids this is all new and is being taught without a basic, direct explanation. The RS method goes all the way back to how babies and toddlers learn to speak a native language and teaches it that way. (I think I will look for a supplemental book to supply this information.)My kids are flying through the lessons and really love it. To them it doesn't feel like work, they find it fun. As the program goes on there is more of a written component using the keyboard to type in material.The system is easy to use and I like the way it keeps a score and how you can't progress past certain points without getting a certain high score. It is easy to navigate through the menu in order to re-do selected lessons.We have been using Rosetta Stone Italian I for about two months and enjoy it. As a homeschooling family, if we were to purchase Rosetta Stone new I'd purchase the homeschool package not the standard package. I also would seriously consider usingFluenz Italian 1 with supplemental Audio CD and Podcastsinstead of Rosetta Stone for a stronger grammar element, but I've not been able to see Fluenz in real life yet (there are online video samples to view on Amazon.com though).

This means you'll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a \"male\", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said \"PO\" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the \"putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them\" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2012", "summary": "Nice system, but way too expensive."}

I'd seen the Rosetta Stone program demonstrated at a kiosk in Grand Central Terminal in NYC and it seemed to be a reasonable investment in getting to know how the program works for me while building some basic vocabulary. I like that it appeals to both my visual learning style and that you can increase the difficulty of pronunciation fluency.Level One covers some pretty basic stuff - things like \"newspaper\", \"egg\" and very easy/common words that you would likely learn early on if immersed in the culture you are studying, which is where I agree with the product description. The headset works with decent reliability but sometimes does not want to let me \"pass\" on a certain word no matter how many times I've said it or how accurate I think I am. I like that the program is based around pictures and spoken word. Since this is just level one I am not sure if this is the best way to learn to speak a new language entirely; for me, this \"flash card effect\" is a good way to learn and reinforce new vocabulary though.If you are planning on ordering more levels it might be advisable to check what deals are offered directly by the company, as they have offered some satisfaction guarantee or money back with certain packages. Either way you should have at least 30 days through Rosetta Stone or Amazon to see if this might be a good fit with no risk if it does not suit your learning style.

I am currently learning Level 1 so I see it only fair to review this. The sequential software will come when I have completed each one of them.The hardware was fine and the headset isn't flimsy.  It's much better than any headphone or headset I bought for myself, but that doesn't mean it can't break or get glitches.  My only (tiny) hardware irk is that all the Audio companions is on a DVD data disc so I had to burn CDs in order to listen to this in my car.  (My iPod is barely used and stays at home.)I had no problems installing the software or getting my computer to recognize the headset.To quote myself in another comment:\"I own a 64-bit Windows Vista and I have separate speakers and headset apart from the headset. The only issue that I ran into is that when I installed the the Rosetta Stone software, it automatically defaults ALL sounds through the headset. I didn't realize this until I started playing my music and trying to video chat. This can be adjusted through Control Panel > Hardware & Sounds > Sound (Right-click this icon and create a shortcut onto your desktop!). In the sound control panel, there will be a \"Playback\" tab and a \"Recording\" tab. (Sorry XP, Win7, Snow Leopard, and all Mac users. Hopefully you get the gist.)\"Rosetta Stone works; but I am the type of learner where complete immersion, repetition, and activities work.  If you have access to Rosetta Online, I recommend the Bingo game and going through the stories.  When using Stories, first listen to it and try to visualize every said detail, then read it.  Doing this paired with the Audio has helped me tremendously.I do find problems with pronunciation. Some of my pronunciation errors are right, but there are a few (e.g. alt, Jahre, Bruder, Englisch) that I have to over-exaggerate certain (wrong sounding) noises to get it to accept. That is REALLY frustrating because I don't hear what I'm incorrectly saying.  What's also frustrating is that it'll accept many other words that I'm nowhere near to pronouncing correctly.  \"Uuuuuuh...\" is sometimes accepted! The pronunciation quirks pester me the most when using this program, but I can't say I run into them too much where it deters me from wanting to continue through the lessons.The Milestones at the end the four units are a bit intimidating especially if you don't use the online resources.  I am usually at a lost for what to say.  It's not obvious all the time.  In this situation, just remain silent.  The program will think there's an error with the microphone. When you have formed the sentence in your mind, continue with the activity.I never use this program without Google Translate opened next to it.  I don't use it to decipher whole sentences or phrases, just a couple words here and there.I don't lean too hard on Google for interpretation because after a while, a learner will see that German words do not correlate to just one meaning.  \"Sie\" can mean she, you, they, it and so on. The meaning depends on the overall sentence.  So it's important to try to think German and try not to interpret every word directly to English.  Rosetta Stone does a good job of giving visuals to let you think in German, but it does not explain any of the Grammar or word rules.  This is why I'm shopping for a German grammar book on Amazon.EXAMPLE: The more I research, the more I see how important it is to when to use \"sie\" and \"du\". Both mean \"you,\" but one is formal and good for strangers and the other is used among friends and family.  And my understanding is that depending on what \"you\" we use makes a difference on the spelling of other words in the same sentence.As someone has mentioned, there's no glossary of words in Rosetta Stone.  So when I want to double-check my spelling or the words I'm using, I have to use Google Translate.****CORRECTION UPDATE**** There is a document of words and phrases learned.  It's located on the CD under \"Documentation\". ****July 12****Overall, I am very pleased with this program and the progress that I am making.  The price is fair to me because it cost less than taking a semester course at my local college and I can access this as many times as I want... whenever I want. Rosetta Stone isn't totally complete with everything you need; and that's why I pair it with Google and other books and tools.  However, that doesn't mean that this doesn't work or isn't worth your investment.  If you understand that learning a language takes constant work and you are determined to teach yourself, buy this. This software is like a teacher.  And since I'm a student, it is up to me to do my homework.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2011", "summary": "I love it, but it has its frustrations."}

In a nutshell, I feel that even minimal information on verb tenses or sentence structure or article usage would be incredibly helpful. Fortunately, my Austrian friends are there to help me (although they seem to think I'm silly to try to learn German when they are happy to speak English to me when I visit!). One friend sent me to this [...] to help me understand. It was very early on in Level 1 that I was confused by all the endings added on without explanation. Yes, you may pick up the patterns at some point, but a bit of explanation would be easier.That said, there is so much repetition, you need not fear the next lesson. And it is pretty enjoyable on the whole. I grew up hearing a little bit of German/Yiddish, so the pronunciation has been easy for me. I am a bit fanatical about accents, so I want to get it right. I am bugged that occasionally the voices will differ during the lesson. Ex.: the pronunciation lessons for 'und' and 'fahrrad' make clear that you hit the D pretty much like a T; but when the female voice says 'fahrrad,' she says it like a D.  Same with 'und'--the male voice says it as a D in one phrase.It's hard to imagine becoming anywhere near fluent without the rules and such, but I'm reviewing Level 1, so that's not for me to say.The headset is very nice and solid.

I learned enough to figure out words in reading, but didn't excel much at the oral part.  I tried this item out for that.  The other one I had for review was the Spanish one.  I gave it one star less than this, though it is pretty much the same program.  I learned more with this kit than the Spanish one, since I took four years of Spanish in high school and retain a lot of it still.  I am still not sure about how to find how much the online lessons are once my trial period of three months that you get free with the kit is over. It is hard to find on the website.  I like the games and layout of the Rosetta Stone program and I am a visual learner and this helps me with the oral part as well.  I like to see as I speak, which is hard to do with audio programs.  This has audio CDs for the car, video games for my computer and online help once I get my French up to speed.  My only complaint about this program is that you can only install in on one computer, so I have one of these on my laptop and the Spanish one on my home computer, since it takes up a good chunk of memory.  I would like the option to put these on any new computers I buy years from now, but RS has a very limited use.  It's like buying a course.  If you have a computer you will use for 5-6 years, it is really worth it.  If you work at home in a field where you need to upgrade your computer more often, you might be disappointed that you can't put it on your new computer.  I wish RS would allow at least this to be installed on two computer, in case the computer you are using fails.This is like taking one semester of French, beginner level, in high school or college.  I learned about the same thing I did in the French course in college and it is less money to do it this way.I think if you are a visual learner, you will like this product.  There is a lot of debate that kids learn better this way, but I think adults can too.  Mind you, that this teaches you very basic French and not beyond present tense really.  Just like a college course.  I like that I can see the words and tend to repeat them better when I see a picture at the same time.  Or maybe I am just a child at heart!Note: I have been using this and another Rosetta Stone for several weeks now and the headset that comes with it has a microphone that isn't so good. Or maybe with use had become not so good. Both my boyfriend and I have trouble getting the microphone to register words we say, even if we say it correctly. For example, even simple Spanish words like Si and Hola get a negative signal even though I am saying it perfectly. I continue at the same volume about 5 times and then, it finally takes it. I wonder if it will become frustrating on high levels where you have to repeat back longer sentences. My Mac doesn't have an external mic, so I have no option but to use the headset and take it off to speak as loud as I can into the microphone. It doesn't seem to matter if I do their \"1,2,3,4,5\" test at regular voice, louder or softer.

It's got good voice recognition software and the use of pictures and the way it tests you to make sure you understand what's going on, allows users to build vocabulary quickly.Note:::There will be a portion of the population, like myself, that will absolutely need to have the system of conjugation written down for them to `see' the logic of it, but that doesn't really detract from the software in my opinion.What does detract is the \"beta\" feel of the administrative part of the software.  Installation and maintenance have been a royal pain in the tuckus.I think my husband described it best when he said:  `Their software is very tightly scripted, but not very adaptive.  If your system is at all different from what the Rosetta Stone programmers anticipated, you will on the phone with the help desk for considerable time.'  That said, their help desk was helpful.INSTALLATION:::  Installation wasn't all that smooth for us.  After we installed the software, it gave us a notice that we needed to upgrade our O/S (a new service pack) and a new version of the Rosetta Stone software's engine. Plus there was some difficulty getting the headphones working, but I can't recall now exactly where the problem lay.MAINTENANCE:::  Yes, who knew there was maintenance.True to form, everything was running exceedingly smoothly for my husband, myself, and my 10 year-old daughter UNTIL the pop-up of death appeared that demanded that it be allowed to install an update.  Being a cautious soul I tried to back out as I `didn't want an update thank you', but guess what.  The software would no longer work.  No more French learning without the update :(Well, since that was a no go, I allowed the  update.  And guess what.  No more French learning.  In fact, the update hosed things up for a good long while, at least until someone had time to call the help desk and spend a good hour fixing the problem.It was amazing how much information was needed to do this.  We had to give the tech not only the Rosetta Stone key, but also  everything about our computer including the clock rate. Go figure. I suppose they are adding to their database trying to narrow in on where the problems are coming from.In any case, it turned out that there was a hidden file that needed to be deleted.  This file told the system that the upgrade was in progress, when in fact it had failed.  There was also a problem that stemmed from the fact that we have different profiles on this particular computer.  One for adults, one for kids.  In the end though that was resolved as well.THE SKINNY:::You are probably surprised by the 4-Stars I've given this program.  But honestly I don't think there's anything that compares to the Rosetta Stone method of learning.My advice would be to only install this software on a newer machine and if possible not allow that computer to connect to the internet until you are ready to use the online features.

Learning foreign plural forms, nouns, and verbs has never been quite so easy...except...The voice recognition works well, but at the same time, it's quite weird to see a word with 7 characters but you only actually make sounds for the first half of the word; granted, it can be like that because of the language...but after using Rosetta Stone, I feel like this bit of awkwardness is actually needed for any serious language learning software.  It *should* be weird at first.The biggest issues I have with the software was:1.  When you first start it up, you're kind of left thinking \"Huh?  Where are the instructions in English?  How am I supposed to match the words (text and vocal) to a picture if I obviously have no idea what they're saying.\"  A short paragraph saying \"here's what you're going to do now\" would eliminate the feeling of \"did I just skip something on accident?\"2.  I'm not very far through it, so it may end up fixing the grammar and syntax later, but some of the words I still don't know what they actually are.  I can get the gist of them, but the matching isn't giving me a definite answer to the words I feel I'm somewhat learning.  (ie, Are the verbs all in the infinitive?)Overall, this is the best language software (and includes audio CD for on-the-go) that I've used, but at the same time, you're really not going to buy software, use it for a couple weeks, and then know everything.  The person wanting to learn (ahem, that's you) really needs to devote themselves and their time into doing it.  From what I've done thus far (not very devoted), I feel like I could understand a book written in French that was written for a 5-6 year old.  (While that may sound like an insult, coming in knowing no French whatsoever and using this software on-and-off for a while, it's actually a big heap of praise.)Would recommend as far as what the product does.  But if you're looking for the best value (perhaps if they'd stop advertising so much, they could lower the price), this is still a great product, but after buying a few Levels, you'd likely be better off taking a class instead.  (And have the motivation because you're \"expected\" to be there and you're trying to \"earn a grade.\")Overall...good software, and if you devote yourself to it, you'll likely be quite successful.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2011", "summary": "Goes against what feels \"natural,\" but it works"}

I've taken Spanish before, but that was almost 10 years ago, and the only other language (besides English) I became proficient at was Hmong, which I learned through a religious text in Hmong and in English, some flash cards and a dictionary that was Hmong to English, in addition to spending time around native speakers daily.I don't believe there is a perfect way to learn a language, and our minds are far different than they were when we were children. Rosetta Stone does seem to be effective, though. I remember almost everything I've learned, and the grammar starts to identify itself as you work through it. I wouldn't go in with the mindset that everything is exactly as it seems; French, like Spanish, has verb tenses, and they all sound similar (moreso than Spanish), but if you watch for them, they become clear. Rosetta Stone makes you work a bit harder for the grammar, but the vocabulary comes pretty easily. I don't believe language learning is easy; it's hard to learn how to say the words, how to use them, and for me, hard to hear them coming from the mouths of natives. Rosetta Stone does a good job because it uses native speakers of both genders to say the words. I think it has its flaws, like how finicky the audio recognition can be, and I find the lessons can get boring because they get a bit repetitive, but I think that is a personal thing.Also, I think it's a great tool for people trying to learn a language who don't have much educational background. Sometimes I would work with old Hmong women, and while they struggled with using the English Rosetta Stone, they would have struggled far more sitting in a class with me trying to teach them through translation, since most of them couldn't read Hmong anyway.I see it as a useful tool, and a unique one amongst the more normal solutions. I still recommend some reading and writing and grammar study, but a lot of that manifests itself in Rosetta Stone if you aren't too lazy about it. Good product. I like it.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2011", "summary": "Not perfect, but effective"}

Installation was easy enough even though the program got stuck a couple of times along the way.

There are plenty of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn't a problem for me yet it's something to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules.

I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.

I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon.  I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former.  Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!  My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, \"Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone.

LOL.So I got this and installed it and tried it out. One key thing that you need to remember is that unless you actually sit there and speak the words then it's not going to do you nearly as much good as it could. Participate in it fully and you'll get much farther than you think you would.Now there are a lot of different language learning softwares on the market but rosetta stone seems to be a very well respected one and from what I've experienced they kind of deserve the respect. Would I like it somethings were different...? Of course, I would like the world to bend to my will... LOL. But none the less it's a great bit of software, well more like a lot of software.Some Pros:Unlike a lot of generic software RS makes it a point to associate words with concepts and ideas while other programs just give you a translation, this helps with the learning process greatly.Vocabulary, without a big vocabulary it's going to be hard to understand what's being said and how to respond. RS teaches you a large variety or words to help with understanding.Cons:I really disliked the lack of language structure given in terms of grammatical uses of the words for spoken language, as in how to speak properly. In this beginners level it seems to concentrate mainly on just teaching you the words instead of giving you a combination of words and how to implement them properly. Granted this is Level 1 but it would have been much nicer if there was a lot more sentence structure given versus just the vocabulary and small hints at structure.All in all it's helpful as I can now make out what my relatives are now saying when I speak to them on skype or other means, which is great but I still have a lot to learn to really speak the language.My other issue with the software is the price.... I find it pretty over priced for what you get in just one level of the software. I haven't tried a whole lot of the other systems out there but I do know a few who have and those who have have all commented that this software is overpriced for what you get compared to other systems out there. Overall, I don't know that I would spend the asking price on this software for what you get with it...Good luck to those that are trying to expand their horizons and learn more languages, I wish you all success.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2012", "summary": "I wanted to learn some of the basics of french and this works pretty good."}

My expectations were high and I didn't have any issues with the software, my brain on the other hand just refused to adapt.

You're not supposed to know the answers before the software asks you to interact.  Rosetta Stone forces your mind to grasp at possible meanings until you puzzle it out, and when you do finally puzzle it out, a light bulb flashes on and true comprehension takes place.Rosetta Stone integrates failure and 'learning by trial and error' directly into the program which, for me, makes the vocabulary and usage far more concrete in my head than being told what something means then picking it out of a list.  What good does that do?If you pay attention to the pictures and the context in which they are displayed, you really can intuit the meanings of the words and phrases.  After you fail to choose the correct answers then finally get it right, this stuff will be burned into your memory because you've been actively engaged in the 'discovery of the language.  Exactly like a kid does.  Exactly what Rosetta Stone claims.To summarize: you can't sit there and passively learn the language.  Rosetta Stone won't download it into your brain.

She stated that she thought this box might be intended for the younger set.  Well, maybe she's right. Maybe I'm just extra young at heart! I love my new jewelry box. I even bought it in the pink (it comes in black and camel). It is roomy and holds lots of pieces within a relatively compact case. It has lots of room for earrings. That is primarily what I own. I don't wear rings, and I only have a handful of necklaces and chains. It also has an absolutely adorable carrying case for travel. This jewelry box also has a mirror under the lid and the whole case folds up and locks securely! I love it!  Before I bought this, I had kept my jewelry in an assortment of little ceramic boxes that cluttered up my dresser.  Now, all is consolidated into a single, attractive case that fits nicely on my dresser. I am very satisfied with my choice.  I might add that I looked at almost every jewelry case that Amazon offered and I kept coming back to this one. The price was right and the product is wonderful.

I'm generally a size 8 or 10 in women's clothing. I took a risk getting this kids tutu but felt okay with the gamble considering other adult women's reviews. I cannot pull this UP over my hips but I can pull it on DOWN over my head and bring it to down to the right level. For a one time use at Halloween, it'll do! If you are an adult any bigger than me, I don't think you will be able to make this work for yourself. I will probably donate this to my niece's play clothes after the holiday is over as it is definitely kiddo size and she will still be able to get plenty of use out of it.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2013", "summary": "Good enough for Halloween!"}

I was looking for a good length tutu that is reasonably short but short enough to please both my boyfriend and I and this tutu was perfect enough.Only downside is that the ends of the tutu look like it was cut with scissors and it makes me worried that for halloween it might come apart while I'm out with my friends.
