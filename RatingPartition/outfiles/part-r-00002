I'll preface this by saying that I was a public school teacher for many years, grew up with languages and spend every day, now, working with Iraqi refugees.  This might sound like the perfect situation to purchase Arabic by Rosetta Stone? Not so.  First of all, the headset/microphone was of poor quality and only picks up my words now and then. It's difficult to score well when the program thinks you are not speaking. Secondly, one should understand that there is not one word of English with this product nor did I receive any instructions on how to use it. It became trial and error. Thirdly, I was unaware that the dialects in Arabic are so numerous that Rosetta stone was not terribly useful when speaking with Iraqis.  This is, by no means, the fault of Rosetta Stone but I wish I knew this before my purchase. Lastly, so many of the lessons used phrases that were of no use to me in the real world in which I work. Again, Rosetta Stone would not have any idea which phrases to teach and which phrases to use but I have, yet, no need to be able to talk about a group of men who might be running or a woman eating an apple. Yes, I am being facetious but not terribly so.Bottom line: do a bit of homework before making this, somewhat, costly investment.

My biggest complaint is I can't get it on him and I am going to have to attempt to alter it a bit so he can wear it. It is a one-piece suit and has only a small opening on the back to put it on. This means the entire thing has to go on from the bottom up. I got his legs in and managed to pull it past his waist with a little wiggling, but when it came to getting his arms in the sleeves, forget it. I couldn't get his arms in at all because the opening is too small. I just hope I can get it on him later because he freaked out and won't let me near him with it. :( I love the costume. It's very cute and he's going to be adorable, but I'm disappointed that I have to attempt to make the opening bigger at risk of ruining the whole thing.Just wanted to update that I did manage to get it on him for Halloween by opening up the seam on the back by another couple of inches. It looked great. We had trouble with the hat, though. It fit him fine and tied under his chin, but when he talked, the movement pulled the Velcro off the one side.

{"reviewerID": "A17NVM7IAPF2NS", "asin": "1608299953", "reviewerName": "Maek", "helpful": [189, 221], "unixReviewTime": 1283126400, "reviewText": "I have heard many great things about Rosetta Stone, but always from the perspective of a TV ad with the usual, glowing testimonials of 30 and 40-somethings who just rave about the product.Naturally, I've always been curious, but have usually been put off by the near $200 price-tag that usually accompanies it.  So, when Amazon Vine had it on offer, I decided to give it a try.Here's what I have to say about it after a week's exposure to my wife (aged 40+) and my daughter (age 7).Generally speaking, Rosetta Stone does a great job in exposing kids to vocabulary.  Nouns are attributed to actual pictorial representations instead of the \"x = y\" approach.  This generally works well, as we do a better job with image recognition than we do with word matching.However, that being said, this kind of representation works well when you're in the early years of school where such learning applies.  As adults, however, we have already a well-established mind set where learning doesn't equate well to a kindergarten-level.  That's typically why we, as adults, sometimes have a hard time relating simple concepts to younger children simply because we tend to use constructs that are far more complex.In other words, while pictorial representations (i.e. \"immersion\") works well to introduce new and unfamiliar words to kids, this doesn't work well when it comes to grammar.  Sentence construction is best introduced in the traditional way of learning how to conjugate \"-er\" verbs in French by establishing simple rules (which account for 65% of the verbs in the French language).  Once those rules are learned, then it's quite easy to follow.Rosetta doesn't take this approach, which is why it hurts both kids and adults for altogether different reasons.  For kids, the immersion approach doesn't work simply because the rules need to be learned by memorization which is an adult concept.  Why do kids say things like, \"I fell down and it hurtED\"...?  Because they take a simple rule, apply it, and they don't realize why it doesn't work; i.e., the \"immersion\" aspect doesn't prepare them for exceptions to rules, rather than the rules themselves.  For the same reason, adults learn better from learning verb conjugation through rules, not immersion; immersion doesn't cover how to conjugate verbs through conditional tense, past imperfect, etc. and French actually has a number of rules that are easier to follow through rote memorization instead of \"here you go...now speak!\"That said, this is only Level 1.  However, I would say that it's a great vocabulary primer...I just wouldn't use it to teach grammar.Maybe it works well for others, which is why I give it the benefit of 3 stars.  Children may benefit from it more because of the general learning construct, but I would have to say that it fails to convey grammar effectively.  The company has been around for awhile.  But from someone who speaks both French and English and has actually seen the difference in learning between various ages, I am somewhat dubious about their claims.

I did have a very small vocabulary already of some Hebrew words and phrases before I bought this.  In all I would say I knew about 100 words, and short phrases such as asking someone how they are, and I did learn how to tell someone that I did not speak Hebrew and ask if they spoke English.  Very basic, but still maybe more than a lot of people getting this program.So here is what I do not like about it.  I understand the importance of immersion, and there is not a speck of English in these lessons, and that is the problem, because no English also means no written English as well.  When pictures are put up you will hear the Hebrew word for it, and it will also be spelled using the Hebrew Alphabet, which of course means nothing to me, or to you if you don't know Hebrew, you obviously don't know the Alphabet.  It would be nice if they had a phonetic spelling of the words in English (like the Hebrew-English phrase books that I own).  I find this to be a big help, being able to read the word helps me to remember and associate the picture to the word, and also helps with pronouncing it.To be honest, I have gotten more useful Hebrew out of the Pimsleur series of introductory Hebrew.  With that I can already speak complete sentences and have small conversations, and order in restaurants etc, and those I can listen to in the car, or at the gym and they cost much less.  As you can see between Rosetta, Pimsleur, and my phrase books, I have taken learning Hebrew pretty seriously, and have invested a good amount on it.  I won't say that I have not gotten anything out of Rosetta Stone, but it is not as magical as the adds that you may have seen make it out to be, and again, I think this may pertain to languages where the alphabet and the characters are so different from English.The last criticism that I have is the included audio files that you get with it that you can download to iTunes.  I was really excited about that until I played them.  All they have is someone saying the Hebrew words from the lessons on them.  Not even the English word first, then the Hebrew word so that you know what it is.  It is like listening to a Hebrew movie or TV show with your eyes closed.  You have no idea what the word means if you don't already know it.  And if you have heard the word before but are not 100% sure on what it is, there is nothing to remind you, either you know it, or you don't, and that is confusing and frustrating.  I don't know how anyone could find that useful.  After about 15 minutes of listening and realizing this I didn't even bother listening to another, and went right back to my Pimsleur cd's.Everyone learns differently, so what is not helpful for me, may be fine for you, but if you think this type of immersion learning is right for you, then go for it, because if you can learn that way, then I think you'd be rocking Hebrew in no time.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2012", "summary": "Not as good as everyone makes you think it is"}

Nelson", "helpful": [88, 98], "unixReviewTime": 1313539200, "reviewText": "Rosetta Stone makes a nicely polished language learning program, with one fairly substantial drawback:  you won't really learn a language.Rosetta's claim is that by learning a language as a child learns (i.e., without translating into another language), you'll internalize the language and eventually be able to think in it, instead of translating on the fly.  This may be true, but it takes children years and years to learn their first language (they're still studying grammar all the way through 8th grade!).  By adopting a child's approach to language learning, Rosetta will leave you lacking in a lot of key areas that other language learning approaches can quickly teach you.If you took any language courses in school, you may remember how much time you spent conjugating irregular verbs and declining nouns.  These tasks may seem like a useless chore, since you can spend months studying and still feel no closer to fluency.  Nevertheless, a good grasp of grammar lays an excellent foundation for language proficiency later.  Children don't learn this way, since there is no simple clip art that can be presented to them to explain the concept of the future plu-perfect conjugation, or the subjunctive mood.  As an adult with (hopefully) a strong grasp on your language of birth, these advanced concepts can be explained to you early on in your study of a second language, so you don't have to spend years and years down the road trying to build a foundation of grammar and syntax underneath a ramshackle house of vocabulary.Rosetta's approach of teaching some elementary vocabulary (boy, girl, runs, walks) and simple relationship words (over, under, next to, etc.) can quickly give you the power to communicate simple concepts in a new language -- which undeniably can be more useful early on than the ability to conjugate the verb \"to be\" in every person, number, mood and tense.  Their choice of vocabulary words for early emphasis won't be particularly helpful to travelers (other language learning systems may teach you more useful traveling vocab, like \"where is the museum\" and \"what time does the train depart\"), but they will give you the ability to communicate simply.Nevertheless, the lack of emphasis on grammar and syntax (again, because there is no translation into English, only pictures of things and actions, with deductive reasoning to pick up the slack), you may find yourself sounding to a native speaker a bit like Tarzan \"us will gone statue and picture place\" instead of \"would you like to go with me to the museum?\"For the skills that Rosetta stone is trying to teach, the approach is appropriate, and the implementation is very nicely polished (although some of the flashcard-pictures have a weird, taken-in-the-1970s vibe to them).  The approach itself is not enough to teach you a language, and completely ignores the advantages that an adult with a good grasp on their first language can bring to learning a second language.  I think that Rosetta, in combination with a more traditional approach to second-language learning, could be a very powerful combination to help you rapidly internalize vocabulary (with Rosetta), and to lay a good foundation of grammar and syntax.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2011", "summary": "Dabbling won't make you fluent"}

For those who, like me, have never tried it before, here is a brief summary. The software immediately places you into an immersion (sights and sound) environment of still photography and phrases pertaining to the photos. You'll be asked to repeat phrases into the headset, and pronunciation counts (however, it's a great relief to those of us who can't roll our Rs that they allow for that!). You'll also need to type, and click on photos that match what is being said. This specific level attempts to teach basic Italian: colors, greetings and farewells, words that would come up in work and school environments, shopping basics, words for articles of clothing, animals, and the like.My background in learning foreign language is the old-style method of memorization. I would create flashcards of individual words. Repetitive writing by hand was one of the most helpful methods I used to learn--something that's not replicated with Rosetta Stone (though some typing is required). Rosetta Stone, in contrast to the old way of teaching, attempts to teach through immersion. Rather than memorization of one word, a word appears in context in a sentence (or shorter grouping of words), and English translations aren't shown. Rosetta Stone doesn't outright teach in English why a verb is conjugated the way it is, how to (or why you must) match an adjective to a noun, or have you learn specifically how to pronounce vowels and consonants. Instead, the software plunges you into learning by exposure to an all-Italian environment.However, this is exactly why Rosetta Stone may not work for a learner like me. Even though it's fun, it's nevertheless frustrating. I want to know how the words relate to my native language. While using the product, I can't help trying to translate everything into English and trying to understand why the grammar is the way it is. And because it's software, I can't go at my own pace. In high school and college, I would read forward to the next unit if I got ahead of my peers, and remove flashcards of words that needed concentrating on.Not knowing the rules of grammar can be frustrating to someone who learns the way I do. The software seems to be geared more toward those who learn visually. For anyone who has not already tried to learn a foreign language, or has found the old-style memorization method doesn't work for them, I would recommend trying Rosetta Stone.

The Japanese tool provides some basics but has much room for improvement. The same difficulties exist with both.(1) The milestones frustrate learners greatly. Only a SINGULAR programmed response is acceptable; there is far too little information to discern it exactly (or even guess something close sometime); and as unacceptable responses mount negativity towards the product grows. This terrible feature (Milestone) should be eliminated or vastly improved.(2) The allowable pronunciation of some runes (boht Japanese and SPanish) is VERY tight, while it is quite loose on others. It is irritating & frustrating. The pronunciation aid screen provides additional insight, but there are a few letters I cannot produce acceptably. In Japanese Shi, Chi, and Sa are far too tight. The use should be able to LOOSEN these.(2a) Even after I produce an acceptable pronunciation, later in the lesson it is rejected. A HUMAN is needed to explain and help. The COMPUTER only defeats the learner's enthusiasm.(2b) In longer words and sentences, the same mispronunciation of the same runes is allowed. The program is inconsistent.(2c) What are you trying to teach? Can a native speaker understand the learner? If so, let it pass - even for single runes.(3) The estimated time for each lesson is FAR too low. To think, read the strange new Japanese runes, pronounce the words (acceptably), and try to impress them into memory requires effort.(4) When new words are introduced through a group of pictures, the learner islimited to SIGHT only. FOUR of the FIVE other senses are NOT ENGAGED. This is NOT AS ADVERTISED \"learning the way you learned your first language.\"(5) Because of this, a collection of pictures (for example family members) should NOT be used to INTRODUCE new words. The method of sound plus 2 pictures then choice of 3 pictures, followed by one picture with audio and a choice of three, followed by audio and the same choice of three is FAR BETTER. At least it involves TWO SENSES.(6) A collection of 4 or more pictures should be programmed to keep the \"NOT\" choice until later among the choices. When the FIRST choice is \"The person is not a DOCTOR\" and there are 4 pictures, one of which is a doctor, it is difficult to pick out the correct picture.

I still have a pretty good retention of the words in the first 8-10 chapters even several years later.  For this I'm giving it 3 stars.My frustration with the product began as images and their meaning started to become more complex.  For example, when you are trying to indicate that an item is in front of another item you really need to know what the perspective is.  Is it from my perspective or from the item's perspective?  Without a teacher, native speaker or some kind of reference material, this is only possible through a leap of intuition.  As my frustration with this type of problem rose, I eventually gave up on the program.It was only later that I found out that Rosetta Stone was actually teaching me the wrong words as well.  I happened to be at EPCOT in the Japan pavillion looking at some of their language books and I read that 'to read' is 'YOMU'.  Rosetta had taught me that \"to read a  book\" is \"hon o yonde imas\".  I asked the girl behind the counter about the apparent contradiction and she confirmed that 'yomu' is the proper verb.  I later learned that 'yonde' means 'to call'.  So I was learning \"to call a book\"?!  Needless to say, I was very disappointed not just in learning the wrong word but in now not knowing if I learned others wrong too.The final straw was when I went to Rosetta Stone and found that there was no option to upgrade without re-purchasing the software.  For the price of this software, a user should be paying to learn the language, not just buying a couple of CDs.  At the least I expected a trade-in program at just the price of shipping.  So, overall, not a positive experience.On a side note, I did the free version of Human Japanese for smart phone and quite enjoyed it.

What I'm reviewing is how the company is advertising their product, because to be perfectly honest it's turning me away from it more than drawing me to it. Rosetta Stone keeps boasting that it will \"teach you the language the way you learned your first language as a child.\"That is complete bullcrap. And it is backed by both Linguistic research and Speech Pathology research. Let me break down what we currently believe happens in language learning, both with first language acquisition and the second.Our native language is learned while we're children. No one knows how or why, but babies and young kids are hardwired to pick up and tease apart sounds and grammatical structures in ways that adults CAN'T. This is because different parts of their brains are being used in this process. Babies aren't only learning by people showing them pictures, they're learning through context, human touch and intonation when spoken to, and simple observation of day to day life. THAT is immersion, and kids are fantastic at it. Kids are also better at learning second languages because they still retain the capacity to sort things out simply through those techniques.Adults can't. Some have an easier time than others. Immersion is still by far the best method because we're forced to try and make sense of what's going on. However, it's the hardest road for a beginner, and quite frankly, no computer program can ever teach by immersion because it doesn't have the qualities stated above as of yet. Just from what I'm reading and seeing, showing a picture and only pictures without translations isn't immersion, and it's definitely not language instruction. My Korean textbook tried this, and for me personally it failed completely. Adults need more guidance until they can get the human kind of immersion. Like what was said before I typed this, we need sounds and videos of examples of the same content.Immersion is learning with all five senses, which is why classrooms and most computer programs fail. Not everyone is a visual learner, just like not everyone can learn through textbooks. You need visual, audio, and even role-playing scenes to get material in your head. And while Rosetta Stone boasts there's no memorization, that's also not good for either children or adults. Guess what? Children memorize, they just do it without thinking about it because they're exposed to the same materials again and again. If you take away the ability to review past lessons and re-do exercises after certain milestones, you're eliminating half of what adults sadly do have to do in order to learn a language.I'm not trying to cast a bad light on Rosetta Stone or anything, I would still like to try the program. I have just graduated university with a degree in Japanese and a minor in Linguistics, and I would like to have a reliable resource to practice with so that I don't lose my skills. But I need repetition, and if this program doesn't allow for that, then I will have to sadly take my money elsewhere.Stop advertising that you're teaching the way we learn as kids, because we don't learn like we did as children, and no computer program as of today's technological capacity can simulate that immersion. It comes off more like a cheap imitation than a program that knows what it's doing.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2012", "summary": "Adults never learn their second language the way they did their first.

Once you write in there, it's good.The second two, it doesn't do as well, at least in black.  Yes, it's distinctive, but not _that_ distinctive.  In my case, it's just another black tag on a black bag.  The other color tags would definitely add more pop and distinctiveness, but also lose the homely Moleskine charm.All in all, it seems sturdy enough to take abuse and will hold your information in it, but does it justify the price differential versus something you could pick up at a drug store?

I wanted an MP3 player that would hold a lot of music so I wouldn't have to keep running to my computer to transfer in new music every time I wanted to listen to something different. This unit does do that, but you pay a price for it. (1) The unit is awkwardly shaped, heavy, and rather bulky. I thought I could get used to this by telling myself that the unit would be like holding a portable CD player. Wrong! It weighs nearly a pound! What's worse is that this units shape makes it feel a little awkward to try to carry it in your hand. I always feel like I'm going to drop it because of it's weird, hard to grip oval shape covered with a slippery plastic case. I just don't enjoy walking around with this large heavy thing in my hand. (2) The battery life is one of its biggest drawbacks. You only get 3-4 hours of usage from a single charge! Talk about stressful! When I'm away from home I'm constantly worried it's going to die after running out of juice again and it leaves me searching for a place to charge it wherever I go. Making sure you always have extra charged batteries with you at all times just adds to the stress! I can't tell you how many times this thing has gone dead on me when I've been out and about. Listening to a portable music player should be fun and a relatively carefree process, and this thing just does not give me that kind of an experience. (3) It takes forever for this player to boot up and load the music! You have to sit and wait a couple minutes during this process before you can start doing anything with it! This is a real drawback if you are the type of person who would be turning it on and off through out the day to listen to a few tunes when you have a little bit of time on the go, like on your lunch break, in between classes or meetings, out doing quick errands, or using it in your car for numerous but short trip where you would have to shut it off upon arrival. This problem simply makes me not want to use this unit when I normally would with a standard MP3 player. I end up just leaving it my bag most the time if I know I'm not going to have a lot of time to listen to it, and with the size and weight issue I don't really enjoy hauling it around in my bag either since I already have enough to carry as it is. ***Basically, this unit was designed to be a stand alone MP3 player plugged into a wall with speakers plugged into it, NOT as a portable &quot;on the go&quot; music player -the unit is just too much of a hassle for it to be truly portable.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2001", "summary": "Unit is too bulky, battery life sucks, &amp; OS too slow !!!"}

The design is nice, the egronomics are great, and the  price is right. However, I have found a few flaws with the bag during my  short tenure.First off, the notebook sleeve is padded on the front, two  sides, and the bottom. There is no padding for the back. While the back is  normally resting on your lower back, I find that in cases where the bag is  set down on the floor a little hard, damage may result from this lack of  padding in this area. Although this is easily fixed by a piece of syrofoam,  I don't see how such an obvious oversight came to be.The second minor  flaw is a missing handstrap. Although the shoulder strap is great for  resting on your shoulder, the longer length makes it a poor handstrap. A  handstrap along the top of the bag would be incredibly handy for just  picking it off the seat next to you, or off the floor for a short walk the  next room, saving the time of heaving it up and slinging it over your  shoulder.Lastly, despite claims to the contrary, this bag will not cut  it for a student, and especially a college student. There is simply not  enough capacity for books and materials. I feel that you can accomdate a  notebook, four medium size books standing up on end, along with a small  assortment of writing utensils. However, the bag at this point is fairly  maxed out, and leaves little room for expansion and other items your work  or your computer may need, such as a mouse and power supply or paper and  files.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2000", "summary": "A few flaws..."}

I purchased it because of theglowing reviews I found everywhere, especially on Creative's excellent support newsgroup.Maybe my high hopes set false expectations, or maybe I'm just though to please, but I was not thrilled with my purchase.I purchased it hoping to go jogging with it, but learned from comments on the newsgroup that because of the shock I better not use it for jogging if I wanted it to continue to work.  It was also a bit too bulky and heavy for jogging.  I thought maybe I could at least use on the treadmill at the health club (i.e. put the unit on the treadmill newspaper rack instead of carrying it) but I never got a chance.Before I tried using at the treadmill, I downloaded the new firmware and installed on my unit, and after that it would not boot!  Creative's tech support said &quot;Wow, I've never heard of a problem like that.&quot;  To their credit and Amazon's, they were both very willing to allow me to return it, either for repair (at Creative) or replacement (via Amazon.)Amazon immediately shipped me another one when they got my email, but ironically they misshipped (I don't blame them, I've order many times from Amazon and this was the first mixup.)  By then, I decided to simply &quot;return&quot; it for good and wait for the item to &quot;mature.&quot;  I told them not to bother sending me another, and I returned both the dead unit and the misshipment.Additional info about the NJB: The carrying case does not have a place for the poor quality headphones, and you can't listen to the NJB when it is in the case because of headphone jack gets in the way (unless you turn the NJB sideways, then the case won't close.)On the positive side, it is a really nice to have all your music in one little box you can carry (almost) anywhere, and if I wanted to use it for different reasons (i.e. not jogging and I carried a backpack that had a pocket to carry it, and the firmware upgrade had worked) I could probably recommend it  The newsgroup is a big plus.On the other hand it is a first generation unit and I think within one year there will be some much better offerings from Creative and other companies.  If you'll be kicking yourself for spending the money today when the unit you *really* want comes out in a year, don't buy it today.  If you won't mind shelving it in a year to buy the latest and greatest, go ahead and get it; you'll probably be happy you did (but not for jogging!)", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2000", "summary": "Some good, some bad"}

It's simply too heavy, large and bulky. The main advantage this player has is it's rather large 6 GB capacity, which I never was able to fill. However, it's negatives outweigh the positives. After using it for a couple of months, the batteries stopped holding a charge, and would only give me a half hour or so of play time.The issues mentioned in my old review such as the inability to fast forward/rewind and inability to upload songs from the player have been resolved with recent firmware and software updates. The headphones are great, and they served me for a long, long time, even after I stopped using the Jukebox itself.In my opinion, it is a far better idea to purchase a portable CD player that is able to play MP3 CDs, such as a Sony MP3 CD discman. It's far cheaper, lighter and easier to use. However, you obviously need a burner to burn the MP3 CDs... or, go buy a newer generation of this product!OLD REVIEW --I just got the Creative Nomad Jukebox today (in blue!) and so far I absolutely love it. I even rollerbladed with it. True, it is a bit bulky, but thats only because it has a laptop hard drive inside it. And hey, it may drain the batteries (or so people say), but when I used it for my 30-45 minute roller blade trip, it served me well. The batteries didn't die on me, and it was almost fresh out of the box. The batteries hadn't even had much charging yet. I don't have any idea why the people are complaining about the headphones and the volume settings. The headphones are comparable to the Sony Backphones, which are probably the greatest lightweight headphones ever made. The headphones are a bit tight out of the box, but I'm sure they will loosen with time. As for the volume issue, you've got to be either deaf, or standing in the middle of a busy airport runway if it's not loud enough for you.  The annoying things about it are:  1. The lack of fast forward/rewind functions  2. The large size (about the size of a Sony Discman player) 3. The delicate state of the player (Although I haven't done this, I don't think a Hard Drive would survive a fall) 4. The player's software doesn't allow you to download songs from the player into the computerThe positive features are: 1. SUPERIOR sound quality 2. Tons of EAX settings, and other sound settings. 3. EXTREME capacity. I dont think I will ever be able to fully use up the 6 gigabyte capacity of this great MP3 player. 4. Comes with an AC adapter. 5. Comes with a leather carry case. 6. The super-fast file transfer time. You can load a whole album on this baby in under 3 minutes. My old Parallel Port MP3 player took 15 minutes for about 3-4 songs. 7. The player comes preloaded with hours of music of different genres, including Pop, Classical, Rock and Electronica.All and all, the positives outweigh the negatives. Of course, you could wait for a better player, but why?

I wish I could give it 3 and a half stars, but 3 will do.  Here's why:The First two days after buying it:  No real problems.  Unit worked great, and I dumped a full 6 gigs of archived music onto it without too much hassle.  The Creative Playcenter software was fairly easy to use, and I had to change a lot of the ID3 information with it, but overall it wasn't too painful.  I do wish that Creative would dump the stupid-looking pseudo-dialogs in their software and devote their time to slicker functionality.  The fact that I can't resize the Playcenter window drives me up the wall every time I open it -- you only get to pick from two small sizes.  Also, how about a pack-in utility to generate ID3 information based on file name?  I had to grab a shareware tagger.On the evening of the third day, I powered up the Nomad for my daily walk (Yes, I've been walking with it, and it hasn't skipped once).  It hung at the 'Preparing Library' screen and never, ever advanced to the Active Queue List.  Pressing the reset button on the bottom of the unit didn't fix it.  Performing a drive cleanup from the maintenance menu didn't fix it.  Finally, I had to completely re-format the whole hard drive and that got it.  Then I had to download all my music to it all over again, and I had to change all the same ID3 information all over again...quite frustrating.  Tech support was quick to comment on the issue (I had a response the next day) but by then I'd already done the format.I realize that before the calamitous crash, I had flashed the Nomad's firmware to 2.91, the latest offered by the Creative website at the time.  It worked for my walk that night, but I wonder if performing the upgrade somehow changes how files are accessed on boot and that's why it crashed.  It's been about two weeks since I restored everything, and there have been no further problems.  In fact, they've added some good functionality, like being able to fast-forward through songs.Now that I've had a lot of time to play with the software (I have Playcenter version 2.5 now) and the hardware, I've decided that I probably can't live without my Nomad for long periods of time.  Being able to take a good portion of my CD collection with me is way, way cool.  I have some suggestions for those of you who are still experiencing problems, for what it's worth:*  Upgrade your Nomad firmware and PC software to the latest versions at Creative's website.  After flashing your firmware, FORMAT your hard drive, and consider losing your music collateral damage.  It'll be much more stable once you're current.  If you're just starting out, do this before you move any music over to it.*  I compressed all of my variable-bitrate and 128kbit .mp3 files to 112 without any audible loss of quality.  Doing this freed up about 20% more space for music.  Not bad!*  Grab a freeware ID3 editor/tagger online.  The tools supplied with the Nomad just aren't good enough.  There are some great bulk-edit utilities out there.*  Creative's Nomad FAQ says you can jog with your player.  I've done it and it works great -- it has yet to skip.  I'd recommend a belt with a pouch for carrying.  This gives it a little more shock resistance as well.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2001", "summary": "Great device, but there are definitely flaws."}

However, there have been some serious problems with it, and Creative's Customer Service has been distinctly lacking.Our first problem was with transferring to the player. We could only do this in small batches (less than a full CD) or they wouldn't make it to the player. And, we couldn't do anything else on our PC. We also tried this on different PCs and on Macs, but had the same problem.Our next problem was that the player locked up (stuck on preparing library screen). The only solution to this problem was to reformat the hard drive. This was a really bad situation, as I was traveling at the time, and therefore lost all the music I had brought with me.When we called Creative Labs about these problems, they were less than helpful. After much arguing and being put on hold (by calling the TOLL number!) they finally agreed to accept the unit back for &quot;testing&quot; as to why it had problems. They did send us a new player, but we haven't had it long enough to know if the problems will resurface.The bottom line is, while the concept is GREAT (when it's working, I love it!0 there are still quite a few bugs that need to be worked out. If you have patience, wait for the next generation of these players.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2001", "summary": "Best of what's out there, BUT..."}

ThePlayCenter software makes it easy to rip/transfer music to theJukebox.  The battery life is reasonable considering the hardwarethat's being supported...anywhere from 3-4 hours depending onfrequency of use and file bitrates.  The 5 minute anti-skip is prettysilly (although it works as advertised) considering that the Jukeboxweighs almost 3 pounds and contains a 6GB hard drive.  Personally, Idon't like jogging with hard drives in my pocket.  The Jukebox'snavigation system is fairly usable but not something my mother coulduse without some training.The absence of forward and rewindcapability has proven to be most annoying.  Perhaps this can berectified with a software update, allowing the user to hold down theSkip Next or Skip Previous buttons to perform these functions.  Also,the inability to compose playlists directly on the Jukebox is quiteirritating as well.  You must go back to the PlayCenter software tocompose and transfer your playlists.The first real problem thatI've discovered ... that the loudness ofthe audio is poor.  I've turned the volume to it's maximum and wasunable to really feel overwhelmed in any way.  I've also fiddled withthe EAX effects and discovered that this &quot;feature&quot; furtherzaps the audio's loudness and adds a noticeable artificial quality tothe sound.The second problem is the sheer slowness of theJukebox's operating system.  This is a serious problem because ALL ofthe Jukebox's functionality is digital - including the slow-to-respondvolume control.  I realize that the Jukebox is a computer, but it'sbeing pitched to consumers as a consumer electronic device and thusshould be as responsive.  Perhaps this problem is rooted in a slow CPUor perhaps it's because the operating system and the file indexes areon the hard drive.  Whatever the reason, this needs some seriouswork.As for accessories, I'd like to see a car audio kit with afixed FM channel transmitter + AC charger.  A simple mounting kitmight be a nice as well.  Also, a remote control with LCD would be awelcome accessory, assuming that the Jukebox can transmit as well asreceive infrared signals.I hope Creative is listening to (orreading) these reviews.  For a v1.0 product, the Jukebox is a goodshot.  Hopefully, they can release some software upgrades to correctsome of the problems I've listed.  And hopefully the next version ofthe Jukebox will correct the issues that software upgrades cannot.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2000", "summary": "Good First Attempt"}

I wish it had zippered pouches, though.  Reviews I read indicated that the exterior pouch didn't zip shut, but I needed a briefcase, and the price was good.

I've had issues before with briefcases and bags I've purchased online, and I think in the future that I'll buy them from brick-and-mortar stores so I can examine them to see if they are exactly what I want.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2012", "summary": "Not a Bad Briefcase"}
