So I asked the guy, \"Is every word in any given language's dictionary contained within the 5 Levels of the course?\" He said, \"No, but it wouldn't need to be.\" What an ignorantly-indoctrinated imbecilic answer!!!So I improvised a real-world example, whereby a dictionary would be useful. I asked, \"What if, upon mastering all 5 Levels, I saw something interesting on the news about Italy & wanted to call my aunt in Italy & say, 'Aunt Mary, I just saw a segment on the local news about Naples.\" Okay, now what if the word SEGMENT was not contained within those 5 Levels or even if it was, but I'd forgotten how to say it? A Dictionary would OBVIOUSLY be needed!!! His response was, \"You could go online & talk to one of our Language Tutors.\" Of course I replied, \"What if I just want to get the bloody word?!?\" Again, he reiterated \"Rosetta Stone will never incorporate those features in its program.\"His final words were, \"I don't understand where you're going with this.

It was sold with a guarantee, but when I wrote to get my money back, I never got an answer.Why did I want my money back?  Well, I was not learning Korean with it despite hundreds of hours with it [I only stuck with it because I had spent so much money and knew of no available alternative at that time].  The pictures were ambiguous and in a few classes unclear [I am not used to seeing a horse's head up so close that I can't recognize it. There is a picture showing a leg and a foot -- which one is meant?  What is being said with the guy falling off in the rodeo or the guy on the skateboard?].  It took me a long time to figure out the prepositions of place without any explanation.The program also doesn't allow for the fact that there are not one-to-one mappings from \"observation\" to a target language for  all prepositions of place [think of the diverse uses of the English preposition of place \"on\"]. In Korean, the words for red and blue have a contrasting initial consonant, that I cannot hear in the program, but the second consonant, though written the same, sounds distinctly different to me.  Maybe these are allophones, maybe not:  But RS is no help here.I worked HARD on this program.  It was one of the most frustrating experiences in my life.  In fact, I got to the point where I knew all the answers but still had no idea what I was saying in 10~20% of them.  The review system seemed faulty:  I would be tested again and again on words and phrases I already knew and got correct -- and not get out of the loop.  This is NOT how I learned my first language.  [Besides that, as an adult, I don't expect, and research does not indicate, that I will learn L1 and L2.]  Here are two places where some guidance would have been helpful:1] Korean has two systems for counting, pure Korean and Sino-Korean.  There are specific applications for each, e.g., for how much something costs versus how things are being bought.  RS teaches one set of numbers, but then times are taught, with-out any explanation that the numbers just learned are simply a different system than what applies to the hours of the day.  2] Korean only uses plural markers and subjects when they are not clear from the context.  But RS seems to be ignorant of this, very early on make a big to-do [as I would if I were teaching English, German or Spanish, for example] of the difference between 'banana' and 'bananas.'  This certainly did not help me when I got to Korea and tried to buy things!The speakers speak rapidly.  This is a natural speed for Seoul natives.  But some allowance should be made for 1] learners and 2] the reality that people in some parts of Korea speak much more slowly.Even  more of the content is questionable: A Korean friend said that the sentences were unrealistic.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2012", "summary": "Rosetta Stone Korean Level 1"}

Rosetta Stone claims to design their software based on the idea that you can learn a second language the way you learned your first one, through so-called immersion. First of all, using Rosetta Stone hardly qualifies as immersion. Secondly, anyone who has studied second language acquisition knows that adults do not and should not learn language as if they were children. It may sound easy because most of us don't remember much about learning our first language, but if you think about it from a common-sense perspective you will realize that even a ten-year old native speaking child still makes many errors. Do you want to spend ten years trying to learn a second language? Second language acquisition programs should take into account the fact that adults have many more language and cognitive skills that they can employ in their language study than children do. A well-developed program would account for this and use this to the learner's advantage. Rosetta Stone does not do this.From a motivational standpoint it is also a very discouraging program. As others have said, it doesn't teach you how to communicate. Pimsleur's audio programs, while still limited in some ways, have the advantage of teaching you language that allows for immediate conversation (or immediate conversation with people you don't know well.) I found it very encouraging that I was able to use the Turkish I learned in my first lesson to strike up a conversation with a Turkish man I met at an international dinner at my university. All I did was asking him if he was a Turk and respond that no, I am American when he asked me if I was Turkish. (You can imagine how please I was to be asked.) But with Rosetta Stone you won't be able to do this. You'll be able to say hello and then point to the people at another table and make the astute observation that they are eating a meal.It is unfortunate that the program is not more useful because resources for Turkish study are quite limited.

I really would not recommend Rosetta Stone products for non-European languages for several reasons, but I focus on the Arabic here (and I assume the learner is a native English speaker):-The type of Arabic this teaches you is called Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Fusha. This is the \"higher register\" of Arabic which is used in formal settings by the educated class: the news, academics, some clerics, most literature. Generally, Arabic speakers use a local dialect of Arabic, which is very, very different from this version of the language. For instance: imagine reading a work of Medieval \"Middle\" English. The language would be mostly quasi-familiar English words, but most of the usage, pronunciation, and grammar would seem tricky, overly complex, or old-fashioned. You would be able to understand some of it, but would miss a bit, too. \"The sky is blue\" would be like \"de heofon ist hewn bleu.\" MSA is like that to 90% of Arabic speakers: not totally gibberish, but not approachable either. Don't misunderstand me though, all Arabic learners should learn MSA, but know that you won't be speaking it much.-The reverse is also a problem. You can speak all the MSA you want (from Rosetta Stone or elsewhere) but almost no one will speak it back to you, and some people will literally laugh in your face for speaking that way. None of the living dialects of Arabic are that close to MSA, so even if you memorized every word of Rosetta Stone Arabic, you would not be able to understand almost anyone who didn't go to university.-To make matters even weirder, Rosetta Stone Arabic included the highly complicated case endings (called Iraab) on all the words. That is to say, there are certain changes to the last vowels of most words in the most formal of formal Arabic literature, like the Qur'an, the Bible, and poetry. These case endings mark what part of speech is being used, so for example \"kitaab\" is \"book,\" \"kitaabun\" is \"book\" if it is the subject of the sentence, \"kitaabi\" is \"book\" if it is direct object, \"kitaaba\" is \"book\" if it is in a prepositional phrase, etc. It is very complex and NO ONE EVER, EVER SPEAKS THAT WAY, even in MSA. Iraab use is technically correct, but even native speakers get confused by it (and rightly so). Not only does it not reflect any normal Arabic speech, because Rosetta Stone does not explain any grammar directly, I seriously doubt anyone would be able to sort out the meanings of the case endings just from context. This one was a major blunder that is mind-boggling for such an expensive product.-More on the grammar bit: it is great that Rosetta Stone wants to avoid speaking English, but Arabic grammar is not intuitive for English speakers. Therefore, unless you already have a fair bit of Arabic grammar, you will be completely confused. For example, in Arabic there is a system of root letters that make up most words. The pattern of these roots changes depending on meaning, so if a book is \"green\" it is \"akhdar,\" but if a car is \"green\" it is \"khadr'.\" Unless you already know that Arabic has a masculine/feminine gender system, and a root for greeness based on the letters kh-d-r, you would not be able to deduce what was happening (I really, really doubt it anyway.) Arabic has lots of grammar that throws English speakers for a loop and needs to be explained directly and in detail: there are tons of ways to pluralize, a \"dual\" case between singular and plural, a very different sentence structure, and on and on.-There is no cultural context provided, which is really strange. Why would I need to know the word for \"sandwich\" in the formal register of Arabic? Why does it teach how to say someone is \"Russian\" or \"Japanese\" and not how to say they are \"Jordanian,\" \"Saudi Arabian,\" or \"Moroccan\"?I could only imagine two reasons someone would find Rosetta Stone Arabic useful:1. If they already spoke some Arabic and wanted a refresher course in the more formal parts of the language, which I guess could happen.2. They wanted to focus specifically on Arabic literature of some sort and already had some familiarity with Arabic grammar and syntax.Do not buy this product if:1. You want to learn Arabic from scratch on your own. You will learn nothing at all, I swear.2. You are traveling to the Arab world and want some basic speaking skills.3. You want to learn about Arab culture or the language's use and history.I didn't intend to rant but this is a very expensive product and it really is not worth the cd its copied on. If you want to learn MSA or one of the many dialects (or better yet, both), get a dictionary, a class, and a plane ticket.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2011", "summary": "Do not use Rosetta Stone for Arabic - it is expensive and useless"}
{"reviewerID": "A22VRSYU0TEUQ0", "asin": "1608299899", "reviewerName": "Brian Carter", "helpful": [16, 23], "unixReviewTime": 1353801600, "reviewText": "There are many different ideas on the best way for adults to learn a foreign language. Much depends on the student, their goals, and their self-discipline. Dealing with a tonal language or a language with a different script, the student need make some big decisions about how they want to learn, and how much. Relatively speaking, Filipino/Pilipino/Tagalog is easy.I learned Spanish as an adult. I am now fluent at a professional/business level. About 10-15% of Tagalog is Spanish, and the spelling of Tagalog words are all based on Spanish sounds.I learned to read Thai. I can write some, but my vocabulary is very small. 90% of my Thai came from taking private one-on-one classes while living in Thailand for 6 months.I studied some Tagalog, some Korean, and some Thai using Rosetta Stone.If you just want to learn some Tagalog to get around as a tourist, enough people speak excellent English in the Philippines you will probably never be able to use it. The Filipinos who don't speak English will typically avoid speaking to you, even when you try to speak Tagalog. Regardless, an immersion product, like Rosetta Stone, is probably not as useful because much of the vocabulary and context is not related to what you will want to know (do you really need to say the boy is under the soccer ball?).If you want to seriously learn the language to be able to carry on casual or business conversations, commit early and realize there is far more work involved. To really practice Tagalog, you will need to go to less savory parts of Manila, or plan on getting outside of Manila, Cebu, away from the red light districts in Olongapo and Angeles, and avoid the resort areas like Puerta Galera and Boracay. To really use Tagalog, you need to go to areas where those who don't speak English are willing to make an effort to understand you.For me, I first needed to learn the alphabet. Since spelling is based on Spanish phonetics and the Roman alphabet, this was easy for me with Tagalog. For other languages, like Thai, you CANNOT consistently pronounce Thai correctly using Romanized phonetics. T one rules are only consistent in Thai script.  Among other challenges, the Romanization is wildly inconsistent. You learn it one way, and then another source using different phonetics mires you in confusion. The same is probably also true of Korean, as it is also a phonetic language. Learning Chinese will likely be different. This part of Tagalog is easy though.Second, I realized for me, I need to take notes. As adults we want to take notes to help remember key points. If you take the notes in English, you are handicapping yourself. This is more difficult, and far more important, in languages with their own script.Third, again for me, I knew learning translation would create a permanent handicap. Early on, translation is easier, later on translation must be unlearned as it stilts actual conversation and thinking. You just can't translate fast enough. Even now, being fluent in Spanish, translating gives me a headache and frustrates me. I either have a conversation in Spanish, thinking in Spanish, or I have a conversation in English thinking in English. If I know a word in one language and not the other, my whole train of thought is derailed. Avoiding learning translation is where Rosetta Stone shines.I like the idea of Rosetta Stone. If you are disciplined and do the lessons, you will expand your spoken vocabulary rapidly. You will remember what you learn. For reading and writing, Rosetta Stone is limited. I doubt it will do much for reading and writing with non-Roman scripts. Like any learning tool, disciplined study will yield results.Rosetta Stone is very expensive. Competing products like L-Lingo or products using different methods like Pimsleur, TellMeMore.com, Assimil, or Fluenz (supposedly the best, but only in a few languages) are a fraction of the cost of Rosetta Stone. Many of the different methods will work better for some people than others. Assimil is translation based. Pimsleur is hard to describe, but has a very good fluency success rate (supposedly). Look up Fluenz also, as the method and reviews suggest it is very effective in the few languages they offer.Besides cost, what is the other drawback to Rosetta Stone?The drawbacks are legion.Version 2 is good. Version 2 is how Rosetta Stone grew into a powerhouse. The voice recognition is very primitive. Version 3 is a refinement of version 2 with improved continuity, a smoother interface, better quizzes, and the ability to get rid of the stupid \"must have CD with you at all times\" limitation. You can also advance or return to the exact spot where you left off earlier.Unfortunately, Rosetta Stone dropped support for Version 2. Even though they were selling version 2 from their own website in 2012, they dropped support. Mac users are especially impacted as Mac OSX Lion will no longer run PPC apps, and Rosetta Stone never ported Version 2 to Intel. So, if you bought Version 2 in 2012 to use on a Mac, you were ripped off by Rosetta Stone. Join the crowd.Windows users should not be too smug about the situation, as the end of Version 2 support means your product will have all sorts of issues too, unless you downgrade to WinXP.Version 3 does run on current platforms, and is at least somewhat supported (to the extent Rosetta Stone supports any product). Version 3 is easily the pinnacle of Rosetta Stone software. Given so many users prefer version 3 to version 4 though, don't be surprised if they pull a Microsoft and force you to their new product nobody wants.Total 4e, is a retrograde of Rosetta Stone. To be fair, if you are always connected -- literally 100% of the time, never a lost packet -- and live your life via social media, Total 4e might be effective. Don't expect to use the highly touted iOS apps on your iPhone or iPad though unless you are connected 100% of the time with those devices also. The whole idea of quickly practicing while in line or waiting in an office...yeah, that doesn't conform to the Rosetta Stone licensing model.Speaking of which, Rosetta Stone now has two components and two licensing models. There is the software application and the online social media part. The application can be run as long as they support it on current platforms. The online social media component is now on a subscription basis. You pay for every month in which you want to participate. You can still use the app on your computer, but you just paid a premium for online access you aren't using unless you continue to pay the subscription.Given there are many free or lower cost websites where learners can interact and practice language skills, why pay Rosetta Stone a monthly premium for less content? Therein lies the reason so many people look at Total 4e and then try to find version 3 before supplies run out.How about another suggestion?Try L-Lingo. L-Lingo uses a very similar learning model to Rosetta Stone. The interface actually has more features than Rosetta Stone and you can customize the interface to use Roman phonetics or native script. They have iPad and iPhone/IPod Touch iOS apps which you can use on a plane, or anywhere else, with or without Internet access. Best of all, all of their programs together (Win or Mac desktop, iPad, iPhone/iPod Touch) are less than half the cost of Rosetta Stone Level I.L-Lingo specializes in Asian languages. They are probably a superior option to Rosetta Stone Total 4e for most users. L-Lingo offers a free trial for their desktop application, and also for their iOS applicastions for some languages.There are other good options listed above, particularly Fluenz and Pimsleur which use different methods.

If you get Rosetta Stone you will need to use a Greek Dictionary and have a tutor to help you interpret what is going on.  If you just wing it without, you will never really understand what you are doing.  You have photo's and sentences and words, but there is no explanation as to what Rosetta Stone is doing or why.  In my humble opinion, it would not be too difficult to make a better product than Rosetta Stone.  All you would need to do is offer some explanations as well as use a different format in some cases.  An advantage is found in the use of the text to speech verification.  However, as for the photos, it is a nifty idea, but the TV is a better visual medium then this, and it is no help at all. So photos alone are not the answer, although it is good idea.  Rosetta Stone also has various glitches.  For example, there will be a sentence, and you have to match it with a photo.  After you get the answer correct there is no way to *easily* check to see what was said in writing without going back where all the sentences are flashed off in the beginning.  They also use the same format for every language, I really question how committed they are to teaching the best way for each language.  I hear they throw in TV and other such things in Latin.There is a WIDE MARGIN for improvements here, so keep your eyes open for the next product, I know I will.  In the mean time get some Greek friends and purchase  Total Greek.  When you finished THEN I would say you can go back to Rosetta Stone.

Yes, it sure is. But it doesn't live up to the expectations. Mainly because of a number of software implementations (or lack thereof), which might be overcome in the next releases of the Nomad Player software and the bundled PC software Package 'Playcenter'. For now, the Nomad Jukebox package doesn't cut it for me, and as such, I have returned, for the first time in my e-shopping life, a product because it didn't met my expectations...A large array of magazine advertisements and articles would let you to believe that the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox is the best of the best of MP3 players. Well, because you can read all about the good stuff about this player in other places, let me focus on the 'features' that ruined my experience with this device.Missing from the package: the line-in cable to record music onto the Nomad player. When I buy a 400+ dollar device, I don't want to have to run to the store to buy a cable to hook the Nomad to my tape deck - especially not because the recording capabilities are one of the advertised features. And, by the way, the cables to connect the Nomad Jukebox to your speakers (or amplifier) are also not included.Unable to record MP3 format. Yes, the Nomad Jukebox can record through it's line-in jack, but only in the bulky WAV format. You then have to upload the file to the PC, convert WAV to MP3 format, and redownload. Ugly. Probably caused by the fact that there is not enough cpu horsepower in the Nomad to encode in MP3 format. This limits the amount of music that you can record on the Nomad Jukebox, as a WAV file is 20x larger than the same MP3 file.No battery life information. There is no way to see the charge-status of the batteries in the Nomad Jukebox. So you don't know if your batteries are fully charged while you are connected to an AC outlet, and you don't know how much longer you will be able to listen to the music while playing on batteries. Ugly - I thought every battery powered device offered a battery status indicator.Ugly filing mechanism. When files are copied from the PC to the Nomad Jukebox player, the filename (and directory structure) on the PC is lost. So if you organized your MP3 files on your PC by means of directories and filenames, you will find this a very unpleasant surprise. While downloading songs, the Nomad Jukebox makes its own filename for each MP3 file, based on the information in the ID3 fields of the MP3 file. And let me tell you: most MP3 files you will have do not have this TAG properly filled out, so make sure you have a few extra days to correct all this on your PC before downloading your music to the Nomad Jukebox. Getting all the ID3 tags of all your MP3 files right is mandatory if you want to use the Nomad Jukebox, a long and tedious job.Download issues Because of the 'Ugly Nomad Jukebox Filing Mechanism' as described above, downloading your music collection from your PC to the Nomad Jukebox is likely to fail. This download stops whenever 2 files with the same 'new derived filename' are detected. And given the fact that all your PC directory and filename information is trashed, and the filenames are deducted from the embedded ID3 information, this is very likely to happen a few times to you.Unable to search for songs. On the MP3 player, you can not search for a song (with the name), or for any keyword (i.e. word in the title of a song). The only searches that are supported are artist searches. Euh ? Did somebody fail to implement all other software routines ? This is very user un-friendly.Unable to navigate within a single track: you can't fast-forward within the same track - real annoying if you are listening to a one-hour radio show or another lengthy piece of music - you always need to (re)start from the beginning of the song.No way to update song information on the Nomad Player. OK, here is the deal: you are listening to your music while traveling, and you notice that the song-information is not accurate. You want to correct the name of the artist, the song, the album, the genre, or anything about the song. Impossible. You need to note it down on a piece of paper, change it on the MP3 song on your PC, and redownload the song to the Nomad. Very user un-friendly. In essence, this also means there is no syncing of any information between the Nomad and the PC - you can only download (wav, mp3) and upload (wav only) between the PC and the Nomad Jukebox, there is really no syncing like with a Palm-pilot to ensure that information is updated once you change it on the PC or the player.Uploading MP3's doesn't work. Surely a software issue, implemented to restrict digital copying ? Frankly, I don't care. When I go down to my friends with my MP3 player, I want them to be able to read/copy what I have on the hard-disc. And I want to be able to hook my player to their PC, download songs, and later on (if I like them) upload them to my PC for backup purposes. I can do this with all removable media MP3 devices, why can't I do this with the Creative Nomad Jukebox ?Hey, perhaps some of these features are available on the Nomad Jukebox, and I just didn't find it. That's definitely possible. The printed documentation included in the package and the software demo included on the CD-Rom are definitely not complete...", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2000", "summary": "Great idea and concept - but software just doesn't cut it"}
