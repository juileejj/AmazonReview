Sadly, I did not discover this until after purchasing and trying the C-String.My wife and I were celebrating our 5th anniversary and I wanted to do something special to surprise her after dinner. I figured that we would have plenty of time that evening as my custom is to spend $1 per year that we've been together on each of our meals and that price point doesn't lend itself to multiple courses.I quickly discovered the C-String while doing alphabetical research on \"exciting underwear\" and I immediately ordered one. Between its exciting novelty and presumed ease of removal (more on this later), I was sure that my wife would feel like the luckiest girl in the world and that this would translate to an exciting evening.3-5 business days later, on our anniversary, I received a discrete brown box with a smile on the outside and giddily ran it upstairs to the bathroom where I could lock the door and be alone. Immediately, I wished that I had brought my computer with me as the product came without instructions and \"installation\" was not turning out to be intuitive. Without an online resource to guide me, I was forced to experiment.As it happens, and completely by accident, my first attempt ended up being correct (in terms of orientation), but I didn't realize it because of the awkward result that the C-String had in parting the company of certain anatomical neighbors for which distance is a source of pain. Plus, the C-String kept slipping down in a way that, from the back, probably resembled a video tape being ejected from a VCR.I tried reversing the garment. This solved the problem of parted anatomy in the front, but created a similar (and similarly painful) issue in the back. I found that squatting and bending forward alleviated some of the pain, but decided that maintaining this position for the entirety of our anniversary celebration, might clue my wife into the the surprise that lay in store for her, thus threatening the full force of its impact and the excitement that would be derived therefrom.Next, I tried wearing donning the C-String in a horizontal, rather than vertical configuration - with the band going around my hip. Initially, I found no discomfort, but as I stood there admiring my ingenuity in the mirror, I realized that something wasn't right. Imagine a pirate with his eyepatch covering his ear instead of his eye and you'll have a pretty good idea of what was going wrong for me.Again, my thoughts wandered to my computer but I could hear movement outside the door and knew that unless I wanted to risk discovery, I was on my own. I studied the C-String intently for a while and decided that the skinny end must go in back. The pain, I decided, I could handle, but how could I prevent it from slipping down? Then it hit me: Maybe the skinny bit at the back wasn't supposed to remain external (if you know what I mean).What happened next is something that I won't share, but it involved deep questions about my level of love and commitment to my wife, a small container of Vaseline, some blood, and some tears. I decided to hide the C-String and come back to it after I had found a computer and an ice pack.Sadly, I did not have time to consult my computer or experiment any further before the time came to depart for the restaurant. Not wanting to waste the C-String, I adjusted the frame ever-so-slightly and told my wife that it was a Google Glass that I was going to use to record our date. Happily, she believed me and was thrilled at the idea. Sadly, she shared my plans with the woman who took our order at the restaurant and we were immediately asked to leave.On the plus side, I didn't have to explain why I didn't have any video of our evening. 2 Stars.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2014", "summary": "Warning: Product is not for Men"}

I like to understand the fundamentals of the way a language works before I just start memorizing words by looking at pictures, and Rosetta Stone doesn't teach you anything about that. You just have to figure it out. I understand the whole concept of immersion, but you need some kind of background on grammar. Five minutes about grammar at the beginning of every new chapter would solve that problem. There are rules that are very basic, like if something ends in A, in Spanish, it's probably feminine. If it ends in O, it's usually, but not always masculine. Regular verbs are conjugated the same way. I love, you love, we love. He is, she is, they are, we are, etc. But Rosetta Stone doesn't teach you anything about the language. They just keep showing you pictures of people doing stuff or eating stuff, and hope that you catch on. I took 4 years of Spanish, and have become more fluent by speaking it. But i also know the rules of the language, so I can read things I haven't seen before. I practiced French and German from cd's  and from books. I learned more from listening to cd's in my car than than Rosetta Stone. There is something to be said for teaching someone how to at least conjugate basic verbs, or explain the differences in gender in nouns. Rosetta Stone is like a video game where you just click on answers, but they don't explain why the answers are wrong or right. You can use common sense to get through the levels without learning much about the language. Then, they give you spelling tests without explaining the special characters. I can't just memorize accent marks because they popped up on the screen. Tell me when accent marks are used in general, so that I can understand when to use them. I don't know how you would ever learn to write in French, because they don't teach you how. They don't explain how to pronounce things, and French has a lot of extra syllables that are silent. They need to explain when, and why, they are silent. They expect you to copy what the people on the recording do. But, copying isn't learning a language.

I thought it would be a great way to store and carry my whole mp3 collection and I was very excited. Unfortunately, I found the software very user unfriendly, the portable itself almost impossible to operate and, worst of all, the worst power-guzzler I've ever seen in a device of its size.The software is easy to install, but to transfer MP3's you have to have full IDV3 tags on each track or it all gets dumped in the wrong folder or playlist, and that means laborious tagging that can take hours. The CDDB tracklistings are sometimes way off base, (it thought my Craig David was a Faith Hill CD or something like that), and when the software rips off CD's, it hardly compresses the files at all, averaging at around 12MB per song (!), which means you're not really using the available 6Gb to its fullest. The playlist/album sorting style is not very efficient, since you have to transfer files to the nomad before you can assign playlists, which means that more often than not you end up with alot of 'stray' albums, (i.e. an album with one or two songs on it). I finally got sick of it and just labelled all my individual songs as having one generic album name and had done with it.Controlling the Nomad itself is rather difficult. You can select playlists or albums and queue them in the general playlist, but the controls are sluggish and the sound is, frankly, near inaudible, even on full blast.Finally, there's the battery issue, which is really the worst of the Nomad's many faults. Creative offers four rechargeable batteries and a power cord for the unit but claims that it is designed to be compatible with other brands of batteries as well. UNFORTUNATELY, I decided to test that on a weekend trip, leaving the bulky DC converter home and deciding to buy batteries as needed. I bought a four pack of Duracell Ultras, and put them in. In HALF AN HOUR the Nomad shut down for lack of battery power. I checked the batteries and found that they still had half their power, but the Nomad refused to start up for more than a second. I bought regular Duracells, and guess what? The Nomad wouldn't even start! Normal batteries don't even have the juice to START the Nomad, let alone power it.I got this as a GIFT and I feel I've been cheated. DON'T waste your money on this one. Try Archon's Jukebox.

I used this for months, as I had German friends traveling to the US and wanted to be able to offer conversation in their native language.  This software fell short (by a long shot).  The pictures work well, but at times can be confusing.  Often, no matter how I spoke a phrase, it would tell me I'm incorrect, conversely, at times when I've been horribly off, I've gotten credit.  The software is easy to use, and reliable, but even receiving a response from their team is like pulling teeth. I had contacted them numerous times for explanations (there's no key or anything textual for me to use as reference other than an alphabet references, just pictures...and figuring those out can be a difficult task as well) and was given very generic responses that led me nowhere.  As the lessons went on, the language became more confusing.  There were articles and demonstratives that were extremely confusing, and I couldn't figure out if they were based on the object or gender/plurality of those speaking (nominative, etc).  I received no verification from Rosetta, simply referring to the dictionary reference, which was of no help. I even attended an online Q&A, which they glossed over my question without an answer! They quickly read it and basically, nonchalantly, referred back to the above, unhelpful reference I was given before. Given the amount you pay for this software, they should provide other pertinent lessons on what I've mentioned (it's an entire topic that could be lent to itself). I was constantly bombarded with emails and pop-ups trying to get me to buy more support or more software, yet I couldn't get anyone to answer my questions and often had to use Google Translate or a plain search on the internet. I think German is quite difficult for a native English speaker to grasp with just this software.  I would recommend this if you have a basic knowledge of a particular language, as it's good for brushing up.  But, for me (and for German), I would not recommend Rosetta Stone.

But, Hindi used a completely different set of characters that are very important to the speaker. So, we learn the pronunciation and sounds, and Rosetta Stone for the other needed parts.We have also used Pimsleur for German and Russian and there have no need for Rosetta Stone.We were using this program to work with the script. It was version 4, which Rosetta Stone says can be put on two computers for five students in a family. That is not true. Because of my eyesight I needed to use a larger screen so I tried to put it on a second computer. It would not activate. I had to delete it from the laptop it was on before I could change it.When I deleted it from the laptop it gave me a set of two numbers, one was the Activation Key, which I already had, and another was the delete number. You had to send both Rosetta Stone before you could activate the program on the exchange computer. Due to a glitch, (in the computer world - one that I have been in since 1979 - glitches happen) and I lost the delete number. I tried to contact Rosetta Stone and work things out so that I could use the program on my larger screen.EDIT: The product now works on both computers. They must have straightened it out in house, but they did not communicate this with me, so I found out by accident. Rosetta Stone is a viable help to Pimsleur since it does have pictures with the words and helps one to visualize certain things. They also help with the Hindi phonetic system and, since that is so different than the Western Alphabet, the help is appreciated. The product is fine, a bit overpriced, but a viable addition to Pimsleur for Hindi. I would not need it for something like German. I can give it two stars now.

The paint job is not that great.  The red is very dull.  Its also lacks the contrast of the greens on the mask.The only pro's is that its a helmet, not a mask, and it has the dent in the top..and an antenna that leans to one side..Thats all the positives I can find.I do not try to find the negatives, but I find the mask is below expectations.

Day after day I sat down with this product, and went through the level one modules.  The problem with learning language becomes immediately apparent when you realize you can say things like \"these are two boys\" or \"the table has five plates\" but cannot say tho most basic survival phrases such as \"Hello my name is_______\".  Also I encountered a phenomenon where I could remember the words when using Rosetta stone, but not in real life on the streets and in the classroom.  I thought I was a terrible language learner.Language acquisition research has shown motivation to be one of the highest factors of success in learning a language.  Rosetta stone is extremely demotivating.  It does not teach practical language.  If they included basic survival conversations from the very beginning, this would be a much better product, however the developers have chosen instead to recreate an experience of using an extremely large and onerous set of flashcards.I had used Rosetta stone for four months.  I saw very little progress in my ability to actually use the language.  Then in Shanghai I bought a simple textbook for about $5 that used dialogues with an audio CD included.  I studied this for a week and my Chinese ability skyrocketed.  This was because I was learning the simple survival language that humans use everyday and I desperately needed.Don't believe the marketing hype.  A child learns their first language over a period of about 7 years.  A baby can learn a bunch of random vocabulary words and simple grammatical structures without needing to say things like where is the bathroom?  The child just has to cry and someone figures out what is wrong.  Most adults would like to avoid sitting in a restaurant and crying until someone figures out they need to use the bathroom.  It is extremely demotivating to know how to say \"He takes the red flowers\" but not be able to say \"I want a glass of water please\".  Buy a $20 textbook with an audio CD.  Go through the lessons and listen to the conversations on the audio CD.  Use the rest of your money to pay a tutor to speak chinese with you.  You will learn Chinese and any other language much faster this way.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2013", "summary": "Learning methods not based on language aquisition research"}

In my experience, it is good for practice if you already know the material being covered. Learning from it as a sole resource is unreasonable. They simply don't spend enough time drilling vocabulary and there is pretty much no grammar being taught.Problem with Rosetta Stone is that they don't explicitly tell you anything in your native language.  Instead, they expect you to infer meanings and make your own connections. The problem with this is that the user will probably end up making the incorrect associations without a parent or teacher to correct them.  Many of the pictures (from which you are expected to derive fairly complex concepts at times) are overly ambiguous.  However, if you already know the language, the pictures can make sense... most of the time.If you are already studying Japanese and you simply need something to help you with listening comprehension, then that is pretty much all this is good for... and really, it isn't great for that.  For the price, you are much better off looking elsewhere.  The websites iKnow.jp, TextFugu.com, and Skritter.com come to mind.  You'll end up getting set back about the same amount of $$ as buying just Level 1 of Rosetta Stone Japanese, but the amount of content you receive is far greater and of a much higher quality.

As a linguist and ESL teacher, I know the limitations of such programs, compared to taking a course or making friends with a speaker of the other language.The best use of Rosetta Stone is for visual learners to pick up basic vocabulary. Even if there were a RS 2 or 3 for Korean, which there isn't, it still wouldn't help you much beyond that. A picture dictionary provides the same benefit, though. It would have far more words than RS does, for $90 cheaper, and it'd be easier to carry around. Plus you could add related words in the margins! Get one with a CD, so you can mimic the pronunciation.The language quality for Rosetta Stone products is hit or miss. For languages such as Spanish or French, the language is perfect. For Korean or Hindi, though, RS products stink. They're full of language errors! Language learners won't know that they're learning bad Arabic or Korean, until they finally make a friend from that culture. By that time, they don't need RS anymore. You'd think their quality control would be much better.There's also an issue with poor service. Years ago, I misplaced my disk 1. This was years ago. RS wants to charge me an exorbitant amount to replace that disk, even though I still have disk 2, so obviously I'm not trying to scam them. So I deducted a star for poor service.My advice for LL is:1. Get a picture dictionary with a CD.2. Stay motivated! Study regularly! Use what you know! Get lots of rest!3. Take good language courses with real instructors who care about you.4. Find ways to make friends with people who speak that language.

The concept behind Rosetta Stone is based on the observation that children can induce the grammar of their mother tongue from examples in which the specific functions of linguistic units are contrasted.  As Rosetta Stone would have it, since children learn effortlessly this way, then why not adults?The problem is that children require millions of impressions to induce the grammar.  Also, when mature humans learn a second language, the syntax of the first language interferes with the notions one constructs of the second.  It's therefore highly inefficient to teach language this way.  With adults it's actually much more efficient to be more explicit about the grammar of the target language -- to provide clear descriptions of the rules accompanied by many examples and much practice.  Immersion can be very useful, but not to the exclusion of explicit instruction in the rules of the language.  I found myself playing a tortured game of 'find waldo', trying to figure out, say, is X the feminine form of some plural article?  One ends up learning a few wooden formulae, but not learning the structure of the language.Aside from this, I found the software implementation to be very weak.  The whole activation mechanism is painful.  If you switch computers or re-install the OS on a machine, you have to go through a tortured process with Rosetta Stone support to obtain a working activation code.  Versions 3 and 4 failed to co-exist on my Win7 x64 system.  When I tried to use V3, an installer was kicked off which quickly failed, after which neither Version 3 nor 4 worked, and I had to reinstall both -- which required the laborious process of obtaining new activation codes (for some reason).  Oh, and forget refunds, if you purchase from Amazon, none are given, even if the software stops working on your machine.The software itself seems to be written using some cross-platform tool that reminds me of Macromedia Director -- hell, it may be just that.  It's laggy, the fonts are ugly, the images are full of artifacts, the UI looks like it was designed by a software intern with no design experience.  The tool to judge pronunciation is horribly insensitive in Version 3 (I speak other Romance languages, so I can tell), and in Version 4 they adjusted to customer complaints by making it far more tolerant, so now it's a joke -- one can score green even with comically distorted renditions of the cues.Here is a complaint letter written by a developer to the CEO of Rosetta: [...]Overall, I suggest steering away from this product.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2011", "summary": "Deeply flawed, in concept and practice."}

I am very well familiar with pronounciation of vowels and dipthongs not normally found in my native tongue.That having been said, I find the Rosetta Stone software's ability to rate my speech as extremely poor.  It often refuses to recognize my voice pronouncing words (and even single syllables).  Moreover, when I repeat a word or phrase into the microphone, it often does not recognize that I have stopped speaking, and the software simply sits there doing nothing. If it were human it would be wearing an idiot's grin.  I am not exaggerating when I say that I repeat a one-syllable word and the program sometimes takes up to 20 seconds to acknowledge it (whether I pronounced the word correctly or not is immaterial). Note that I am using a state-of-the-art PC, so hardware isn't the issue.Furthermore, the Rosetta Stone \"immersion\" approach to language learning is not good for anyone who has learned a second or third language through formal lessons.  The software is designed to NOT take your native tongue into account, but the only benefit of that is to Rosetta Stone, NOT the learner.  Many languages have sets of rules regarding gender agreement or unorthodox pronounciation; most languages have regular rules about conjugation.  RS imparts NONE of these rules; doing so would require an explanation in every native tongue.  Instead, you are left to figure it out on your own. This seriously impedes the process.  What this product will do is teach you to speak BAD Swedish.In short, if this is your first attempt at learning a non-native language, it might work for you.

Since they offered a trial or demo disk, I ordered a disk and tried it.  It seemed good and I liked all the improvements over version 2.  So I decided to buy the the program.  To Rosetta Stone's credit, this version is a giant step forward in interaction and variation of teaching methods to keep the Vietnamese student involved and interested.  The package includes a headphone & microphone set so you can speak the words you hear, and the computer will let you know if you're pronouncing the words and phrases correctly.  In fact, you can set the program's tolerance level of your pronounciation.  This new version also allows you to type in the words and phrases your hear, thereby helping you to learn how to spell the new language you are speaking.Unfortunately, in spite of all these new improvements, there were two problems (serious problems in my evaluation) that made me return the program for a refund.  The first problem was pronounciation.  Vietnamese is a tonal language; in fact, it has 6 different tones.  Also, there is a significant difference between the North Vietnamese dialect and the South Vietnamese dialect.  This program proportedly teaches the northern dialect, but the pronounciation is not correct.  In version 2, the pronounciation was textbook perfect; each tone was distinct and precise.  In version 4, they've gotten sloppy.  Specifically the high-rising tone used in some words (like con cho' [= dog], con ga'i [= girl], etc.) is pronounced  with a falling, rising tone (like pha?i [= yes] or ho?i [= question].  My wife, who is Vietnamese, confirmed these mispronounciations.The other problem is the method used to type in Vietnamese words.  When Vietnamese people type proper Vietnamese with tone marks, they usually use one of two methods: VIQR and VNI. (Look up these methods on the internet.)  But, Rosetta Stone doesn't use either of these common methods; instead have come up with their own method.  Unfortunately, it is very cumbersome and painfully slow.So, because of these 2 serious problems, I can't fully reccommend this program.  There are many other programs available that teach Vietnamese.  One I CAN recommend is called \"A Little Vietnamese\" by Griesser Software.  This program is unique in that it teaches both North and South Vietnamese dialects and the differences between them.  Unfortunately, it does not work on Macintosh computers, unless you have a Windows-simulator program (like Virtual PC or Parallels).

Took it in to a watch repair store and they said this was not the first one they saw that the housing broke away.Too bad the quality did not match the features.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2006", "summary": "OK Features - Poor Quality materials"}

Not pink like pictured, more salmon colored, but looking great. They are not light, they are made of good rubber material. BUT here is the problem, the edges of the straps are so sharp that it's impossible to wear. They will give you nasty cuts. I only wore them around the house today and I have cuts on my toes. Such a shame because they are so pretty and they're made out of such great quality rubber.
