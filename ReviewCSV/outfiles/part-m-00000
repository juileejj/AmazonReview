0000031887,5.0,Perfect red tutu for the price. I baught it as part of my daughters Halloween costume and it looked great on her.
0000031887,4.0,This was a really cute tutu the only problem is that it was super short on my 5 yr old daughter. Other than that it was really adorable.
0000031887,2.0,the tutu color was very nice. the only issue with this tutu is the quality of material used. it appears cheap and after much play my 3 year old managed to snag a piece of the fabric and that was the end of life for this particular tutu.
0000031887,1.0,My 3-yr-old daughter received this as a gift for her birthday.  She's no pixy, but she's not huge either, and it was VERY tight on her, so I doubt a 6 year old can fit it comfortably.  The tutu fell apart after 12 hours -- the satin waistband detached from the tulle.  Unless twirling counts as rough wear, I'd say this was poorly constructed.  I sent two messages to Sydney So Sweet directly, trying to get a replacement or at least some kind of acknowledgement and NOTHING.  So ... crappy construction and crappy customer service.  I already don't like tutu/fairy/princess stuff, and this just furthers my opinion that companies like this are preying on daughters.  Boo!
0000031887,4.0,Bought it for my daughters first birthday which is lady bug themed and it fits perfect the stitching is a little loose but only need it one day
0000031887,4.0,I ordered this for a costume for me (I'm a 5'5" adult) and was surprised by the quality considering it was under $10.  The tulle is double layered and the waistband is satin and very comfortable.  The waistband stretches to about 30".
0000031887,5.0,This is a great tutu and at a really great price. It doesn't look cheap at all. I'm so glad I looked on Amazon and found such an affordable tutu that isn't made poorly. A++
0000031887,5.0,Got this for our youngest kid, she loves it. Its big and made better than the last cheap tutu we got for her.
0000031887,5.0,I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for dance class, she wore it today for the first time and the teacher thought it was adorable. I bought this to go with a light blue long sleeve leotard and was happy the colors matched up great. Price was very good too since some of these go for over $15.00 dollars.
0000031887,5.0,Just as described and arrived fast-although I upgraded shipping options in hopes it would arrive in time for a school function (it did!)  Amazing price too!  This tutu is 3 layers- much better quality than I expected given the low cost!
0000031887,5.0,Purchased it for my daughter bc she needed a red tutu for her costume. It was really cute but it was not that puffy but it did the job.
0000031887,5.0,This really is a nice tutu for the price. It has multiple layers and is not cheaply made. For me the shipping was not very fast but it was very worth the money spent.
0000031887,4.0,Very cute, shorter than I was expecting, but then again, I didn't bother to calculate the measurements before ordering it. It has three layers of tulle, so it's not as full as the picture looks if stretched fully, but still a full skirt. I bought this skirt for my six year-old niece, so I highly doubt the skirt will ever be stretched to its full capacity on her. In fact, the skirt stretches pretty far but is also retractable so it can fit a variety of sizes.
0000031887,5.0,Vey cute and perfect for my 6 yr old daughter. She wore it to a princess birthday party. Lots of fun.
0000031887,5.0,Bought this for my 12 year old niece whom has the shape and figure of a twenty-something year old! It went under her Halloween costume and while I didn't think it was going to fit the circumference of her waist, it surprisingly DID! She wore it all night at her school dance and then again on a trick-or-treating outing and was comfortable the entire time! Thank you for making such a versatile product!
0000031887,5.0,Loved it and so did my daughter! Super cute and will stand up to many uses! She went as Ladybug Girl and looked the part with this tutu. :)
0000031887,4.0,I just got this today! I can't wait to see how it will look with my costume for halloween. I'm hoping it will be durable enough since I'm going down to Santa Barbara in this.I was a little iffy on getting this at first just because I read "fit's kids ages 3-10" but I'm 5"1 114lbs and it sits perfectly on my waist. I was looking for a good length tutu that is reasonably short but short enough to please both my boyfriend and I and this tutu was perfect enough.Only downside is that the ends of the tutu look like it was cut with scissors and it makes me worried that for halloween it might come apart while I'm out with my friends. We'll see though, the tutu is still cute and completes my outfit (:
0000031887,5.0,Our 3-year-old petite granddaughter loves it!  I was afraid it might not be small enough, but it fit well with room for future growth!
0000031887,1.0,It was beautiful when I first received it. My 4yr old wore it once to her ballet class and it already started to come off the seams after one hour of use. I didn't bother returning it because my little one was about to throw a fit when I told her we were going to send it back. It was cheap anyway, ya get what you pay for. I just sewed it back together.
0000031887,3.0,The waistband was not sewed properly. I had to sew the front to the back myself so it would stay in place when it was worn.
0000031887,5.0,The tutu's was for my neice... She LOVED IT!!!  It fit well and will fit her for some time with the elastic waist.... great quality and very  inexpensive!  I would buy her another easily.
0000031887,5.0,My 5 year old daughter get this today for Christmas.  She and we are very pleased with it.  Thank you so much!
0000031887,4.0,This is a very basic tutu not a lot of layers like a "full" tutu but great for play or dress up.
0000031887,3.0,tutus are amazing. i love them and so does my sisters. my whole family weres them and use to wear them .
0000031887,5.0,I bought this as part of my halloween costume. It says it fits kids up to 10 years old. I'm 24 (size 1-3 in jeans depending on brand) but it fits perfectly. The only problem is it has a slightly odd odor. but i sprayed it down with perfume. lol so that took care of that problem! I Highly recommend this seller because they ship orders very fast.
0000031887,4.0,I bought this tutu as part of a costume for myself. I'm generally a size 8 or 10 in women's clothing. I took a risk getting this kids tutu but felt okay with the gamble considering other adult women's reviews. I cannot pull this UP over my hips but I can pull it on DOWN over my head and bring it to down to the right level. For a one time use at Halloween, it'll do! If you are an adult any bigger than me, I don't think you will be able to make this work for yourself. I will probably donate this to my niece's play clothes after the holiday is over as it is definitely kiddo size and she will still be able to get plenty of use out of it.
0000031887,5.0,Great product for the price.  There aren't many ballet classes available for my 4 year old so it doesn't get a lot of wear and tear but it's great for the times we need it.
0000031887,5.0,The tutu was the right color and fit my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter perfectly.  The price was right , too!
0000031887,4.0,These tutus fit my 5T/XS 5 year old and my 2T 2 year old very well, and look adorable! The quality seems good so far, too.
0000031887,5.0,This is a very cute tutu! The purple is so pretty!  Nicely made for a $7 tutu!  So glad I purchased it!
0000031887,5.0,I ordered this tutu for my 2 yr old granddaughter who loves tutus and expecially yellow ones. It is slightly big/long but she is able to wear it without a problem. She will be able to wear it for several years. So very adorable!! Well made, too.
0000031887,4.0,This tutu is very basic, but that's a good thing if you are ordering it for a costume, since it's easy to dress up and change into whatever you might need it to be. It was a great value, for the price the quality is very good. My daughter is 6, and a little chunky, but the elastic waist band fit her perfect (she is about a size 10 girls).
0000031887,5.0,Got this product thinking it was going to cheap and flimsy but it was just for my 2 year old to dress up went ahead and ordered it. I was blown away by how fast I got it (ordered it on a friday evening recieved it on monday morning) and the quality was wonderful. The color was a very nice purple and my little one loves it!
0000031887,3.0,It is a fine tutu, true to its price. My little ones liked it. Shipping is really fast. I would recommend it to others.
0000031887,5.0,excellent quality and a fast shipper.  i have a very active grand daug.,  and it has held up very well.  great buy.
0000031887,5.0,This tutu is exceptional.  I purchased several and my granddaughter loves every one of them and plays with them constantly.  Very pleased with this product and purchase.  The price is extremely reasonable.  Highly recommend this product.
0000031887,3.0,I was expecting a fuller tutu, but it still worked and looked pretty good.  Got here fast!  The color was perfect.
0000031887,5.0,Tutu is always a hit for young girls and my Grand daughter loves hers. Sometimes Momma can't get her out of it.
0000031887,5.0,Bought this for my 7yr old niece and she absolutely loved it. It was poofy, and great quality. Has an elastic waistband which is nice as I decided to try on myself when we played with barbies lol!!!
0000031887,5.0,Absolutely beautiful costume.  Very soft and breezy!  My granddaughter loves it!  Super fast delivery!  Thanks!  Wouldn't hesitate ordering more!  Runs true to size
0000031887,5.0,This was the skirt for my daughters halloween costume this year.  I have made lots of tutus, but this was so much easier and cheaper in the long run!  Also ordered orange!  A no-brainer.
0000031887,4.0,Cute tutus.  Definitely dress up play item.  Which is what we were looking for.  My little one loves to wear them around the house.  Good product for the price.
0000031887,4.0,I was slightly worried about it fitting, but the elastic in it works well. I am a 28 year old, wear anywhere from 5-9 size jeans (depending on the brand), and this tutu fit great. Wore it for a Costume Party Run Half Marathon (part of my Batman Costume) and it worked great. Wish it would have been a little fuller, but it did its job.
0000031887,5.0,My daughter and a friend were dressing up for Halloween as a 80's rock star.  This tutu worked perfectly.  It arrived very quickly and was just what we needed to finish off their outfits.
0000031887,5.0,What can I say... my daughters have it in orange, black, white and pink and I am thinking to buy for they the fuccia one. It is a very good way for exalt a dancer outfit: great colors, comfortable, looks great, easy to wear, durables and little girls love it. I think it is a great buy for costumer and play too.
0000031887,5.0,We bought several tutus at once, and they are got high reviews. Sturdy and seemingly well-made. The girls have been wearing them regularly, including out to play, and the tutus have stood up well. Fits the 3-yr old & the 5-yr old well. Clearly plenty of room to grow. Only con is that when the kids pull off the tutus, the waste band gets twisted, and an adult has to un-tangle. But this is not difficult.
0000031887,1.0,My daughter wore this for two hours on Halloween, after just the one use it was falling apart.  Poor quality, I would not recommend.
0000031887,5.0,It was exactly as described. Very happy with the product. .... .. .... ..... ..... .. ... .... .... ..
0000031887,5.0,I purchased these for my grandchildren ages 6 & 3 for Christmas & they love them. They are well made & the colors are beautiful.
0000031887,2.0,This tutu is really long on my 40&#34; daughter. It doesn't pouf out much either. It's more like a see through skirt. The two layers of touille get twisted every time she takes it off and I have to fight with it to figure out which is right side out again. Pretty cheap construction.
0000031887,1.0,my 8 year old daughter wore this 1 time for a couple hours for a school play and it fell right apart. she was upset and so was i.
0000031887,5.0,Thank you Halo Heaven great product for Little Girls.  My Great Grand Daughters Love these Tutu's.  Will buy more from this seller.  Made well and cute on the girls.  Thanks for a great product.NEVER BUY FROM DRESS UP DREAMS........I will buy more as long as I don't buy from &#34;Dress Up Dreams&#34;  I never rec'd or order in FL. Only rec'd pink, the purple one was missing.  Company is a rip off.  REFUSES to make good on purchase...... Real creeps.
0000031887,5.0,This is a good length, works for an adult, looks cute on and will be fun to wear. Great buy!
0000031887,4.0,I received this today and I'm not a fan of it but my daughter is I thought it would be puffier as it looks in the pic but it's not and the one they sent me is pink underneath and the waist band is pink which is not what I wanted due to the fact she already had the sandals she was gonna wear with it now I gotta find another pair of sandals,ima just keep it cuz she likes it.
0000031887,5.0,Bought this tutu for my 3.5yr old.  Fits her well around the waist, she's very happy.  Satin around the waist, other edges are unfinished.
0000031887,4.0,This tutu could be used for a kid...or a small adult--so it was perfect for me!  The waistband was decent quality and it worked great for my Halloween costume.
0000031887,3.0,This tutu lasted for a few months, but then the elastic lost it's elasticity....For the price it was worth it though.
0000031887,5.0,It is a little big for my 2 year old, but she wears a 3t.  She is a big girl for her age.  It is a little long but fits good around her waist.  She likes to dress herself and she is not "easy" doing so.  I was worried she would have it ripped but so far she has not.  It has really held up to her ruffness.  Wish I bought other colors and still just might
0000031887,5.0,I bought this for a race I was doing.  I was a little nervous buying a costume item that is marketed in child sizes.  I'm 27, 112 lbs, 5'3&#34;.  The tutu worked out perfectly and its expandable waistband could easily have stretched even further.  I also cut it to make it a little shorter.  Overall, great buy for the price.
0000031887,5.0,Highly recommended for basic little girls tutu. Great for kids who are still growing and might need a size change later on.
0000031887,5.0,I looked all over amazon for a tutu, I wanted a nice full one. After much debate I decided to take my chances on this one, the price is great which also did actually worry me. I received it yesterday and it FAR exceeds my expectations, it's beautiful, LOVE IT. It's very full with 3 layers of tulle and a nice satin finished waistband. My daughter is 1 and has a tiny waist, I thought I would have to take it in when I got it but amazingly it fits her and she has PLENTY of room to grow in it as well. It is pretty long on her right now like a full length tutu but that makes it even prettier on her at this point. As she grows obviously it will become shorter, I can't believe I paid this price for such a cute tutu that she can have and grow into for a few years to come, fantastic. I didn't even have to iron it, it was packaged straight no crinkles.
0000031887,1.0,what was sent to me is a royal blue tutu - not turquoise, turquoise has a touch of green to it.
0000031887,3.0,This was a one-size-fits-all toddlers skirt. My toddler niece is swimming in it. I don't mind because toddlers grow fast so I'm sure she'll be wearing it within a year or so. She loves tutus, so she'll wear it before then as well...it'll just be a large skirt...like a dress.
0000031887,5.0,I sent it to my granddaughter for her 4th birthday and she LOVED it!  Wore it around the house over her long pants.
0000031887,5.0,Very nice for the price! Washed by hand and held up nicely. The quality is nice and my daugher loves it!
0000031887,4.0,These were a good buy - great color and quality for the price. Bought them for a ballet themed party and girls loved them!
0000031887,5.0,My daughter wore this at her first dance recital.  I wasn't expecting much since it was so cheap.  It is suprizingly soft, and the length was great.  She stood out from other girls that had homeade tutu's and I can't imagine that one could be made for cheaper than the $7 I paid for it.
0000031887,5.0,Bought this as a backup to the regular ballet outfit my daughter has to wear. So far, she's using it to play out her Cinderella dreams but I am sure we'll be able to use it for a recital sometime soon. The quality is just fine for the price we paid. I was not expecting a designer skirt for this price and got exactly what I paid for.
0000031887,5.0,I wanted it for a one time use, and after that i kept it for playing. Very nice looking on the first use, you could see it staring to wear after the first use. If fit my 2y old just fine, and my 6y old too.
0000031887,5.0,my daughter loves it, we bought for her ballet classes and it's perfect i would recomend to anyone looking for one
0000031887,5.0,It is nice and full and the construction of the tutu is well done .  The other reviews of this item were right on - 5 stars.
0000031887,1.0,Another example of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  Just know that it does not stand out as pictured, there is no ballet tutu stiffness to it, but if you want a purple soft tulle skirt skirt with cheap elastic waist, it works. Same texture as chiffon.
0000031887,5.0,Our granddaughter immedicately put her tutu on when it came in the mail. She loved it! She even wore it over her clothes to chuch that following Sunday. It was great to see to see her so happy. However, after I bought it, I found out Walmart was selling them for only $5 and I wouldn't have had to pay shipping and Handling. The look on my granddaughter's face was well worth the extra money.
0000031887,5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter as part of her Halloween costume.  Now she never takes it off.  She loves it.
0000031887,5.0,This is perfect my niece love it.  It fit perfect she is 4years olds not to big just right.I love that it has a lining, i purchase one from another store but I had to get legging for her to wear under the tutu.I will purchase another one or two.
0000031887,5.0,My toddler love this so much. It has held well. She wears this several times a week. We have three colors of this from the same seller.
0000031887,5.0,Love the &#34;feel&#34;....the length is great on a 7 year old.....the waistline fits (that never happens because they always need to have tucks taken)...the look is fabulous and the price is even better!!!
0000031887,1.0,They fell apart the first day that they wore them...I literally had to throw them away....disapointed....still waiting for replacements.....poorly made....
0000031887,5.0,Our granddaughter is so into dress-up and this, with the Lady bug wing set, was a great alternative to princesses!
0000031887,4.0,Got this for my 2 year old daughter and I expected it to be very thin and flimsy considering the price. I was totally wrong. The skirt is very full and has many layers. Very happy with the purchase and she looks adorable in it!
0000031887,1.0,This tutu fell apart literally minutes after my niece put it on. I wasn't impressed with the quality, though I suppose for the price I shouldn't have been surprised.
0000031887,5.0,Great price! This cute little tutu has held up through multiple wearings by a three-year old. We even bought two more!
0000031887,4.0,My granddaughter loved it. She is only 4 years old and loves being a little ballerina. She is my little ballerina!
0000031887,5.0,I bought this for my daughters cinderella party. I am pleasantly surprised with the fullness and the price cannot be beat!
0000031887,4.0,This skirt is SUPER cute.  My only problem w it was it had a strong odor upon arrival. I have to assume its in the dye but unfortunately it smells just like urine.  Once I sprayed it with Febreeze and let it air out, the smell is not so strong.  Other than that it is good quality and well worth the money.
0000031887,5.0,they were great and loved the red satin around the waist.  I would have had to make them for the recital and didn't really have time.  The cost was reasonable as well.
0000031887,5.0,The tutu looks just like the picture, no surprises. The nylon net is good quality and the elastic waist fit my tiny waisted grand daughter.
0000031887,5.0,I wanted well-made dress-up items for my granddaughter and this is great!  I chose pink but there are many colors available.
0000031887,1.0,Said they would fit a certain size but when we got them they are a lot smaller then as described.
0000031887,4.0,My daughter's first request out of bed in the morning is "I want tutu!!" So I knew I needed to find some durable options fast. This is one of three I purchased. The quality is ... What you should expect from tulle. It frays easily on the bottom. For occasional dress up this is perfect. For an everyday tutu uniform, it's going to fall short. I think I'll try to add this as a subscribe and save item.
0000031887,3.0,Twice we've had to repair it. It rips along the ribbon-the tulle pulls away. My mom reinforced it but it still ripped.
0000031887,5.0,A beautiful yellow, not too bright. It has three layers which makes for a nicely shaped tutu. Good for up to 10 years old.
0000031887,5.0,My granddaughter was thrilled when her ballet teacher said she could wear any color tutu she wanted.  All of her classmates have pink.  My granddaughter dances to her own beat.  She is almost 6 years old and to have a green tutu that is the perfect green is wonderful.
0000031887,5.0,My two-year-old wears it everywhere.  Perfect choice for a little girly girl!  Now she can dress up like her big sister.
0000031887,5.0,my little 3 year old and 1 year old love dressing up in these!!!  very well made and very poofy!!!
0000031887,1.0,Both tutus were mailed in a flat plastic bag in a manila envelope.  Needless to say, they arrived perfectly flat, not at all like the fluffy tutu shown in the photo.  I had to purchase 6 yards of red netting, cut into strips, gather it, and sew it onto the flattened netting of both tutus.  I have purchased tutu's from other sources that shipped them in 12x12 boxes so that when they arrived, they were, indeed, the fluffy tutu I had ordered.
0000031887,1.0,put it in the washer bc like a normal kid my daughter got it dirty. When i took it out it was all ripped up at the ends. she was so uppset when i got rid of it for the price i paid I thought it would be a little better.
0000031887,1.0,Very cute however poorly made. This tutu didnt last a full day before it was coming apart at the seams.  Which is really too bad because my 6 yr old was really excited about wearing it again.
0000031887,4.0,This is an average tutu.  It fits my 3 year old fine and is cute, but it is sort of stiff and smells very chemically.  I have yet to wash it, so maybe after I do it will soften and lose the smell.  *Followup- I have washed it and it is better, not so smelly and stiff.  I changed my rating to 4 stars.
0000031887,5.0,Great tutu for a great price. It isn't a &#34;full&#34; or high quality skirt, but it is perfect for my daughter to wear over leggings for her little outfits.
0000031887,5.0,The tutu was exactly as pictured in the photo and arrived a few days earlier then I expected it to arrive.
0000031887,5.0,My granddaughter wanted this as a surprise for her mother for Christmas..  She actually wanted it to dress up a large bear she had.  It was well made and for the price, you could not beat it.
0000031887,4.0,My daughter liked this, and it with her costume, but she would have liked it to be a bit fuller.
0000031887,5.0,For what I paid for two tutus is unbeatable anywhere!  I ordered a pink and turquios and they are vibrant and beautiful! The tutu is very full! Princess style! Not cheaply made! Not cheap materia! Obviously someone made these with love and care! I paid less than 7 bucks for a tutu I and I feel proud of my self for researching to the point of finding gold!Recommend 2-6 years!My daughter is two ! Wears size 4t and this skirt ( one size ) fit perfect and will probaly be able to accommodate her quickly growing waist for some time!
0000031887,4.0,Bought this tutu for a tutu and heels bachelorette party. It says its for kids but worked out great.I weigh 135lb and 5'8&#34;. I wore legging underneath or would have been exposed.Great thing is my 2 year old daughter can use it and loves it!]Material is not bad but don't expect it to last long. Worth it for the price.
0000031887,4.0,Got this for my niece and she loved it!  There is a silk lining so that it doesn't scratch the legs which is a big plus! Shipped fast too.
0000031887,5.0,I used this to complete my ballerina Thor costume and it worked PERFECTLY! I still have it and it's in great condition. A little staticky but that's to be expected. I bought shorts to go underneath, so it was great.
0000031887,4.0,I got this for my sister she is in love with I'm very happy with the shape color everything !! Really great product I love it !!!! Fantastic !
0000031887,4.0,The shipping is crazy on these if you're buying more than one of these, but the tutus are really well made. I glued snowflakes to them as party favors for a Frozen birthday party and the girls loved them!
0000031887,5.0,Pretty good quality tutu for a great price.  My daughter loves this for her tot ballet class.  It even seems to hold up ok to washing machine as long as I wash on delicate, which many of her other tutus have not turned out as well.
0000031887,5.0,Perfect for my 3 year old daughter! Bought it for her bday party, but it came a day later, but not their fault! She likes to wear it with tshirts and crocs and wears it over spandex shorts! It's definitely puffy enough!
0000031887,5.0,Wonder my niece wears it every single day, yellow is her favorite color right now an this cute little tutu made he da. It is well built and we hope she gets lots of wear out of it.
0000031887,1.0,My daughter wore this every other day for maybe half an hour at most.  The waistband has completely separated from the elastic after two weeks of this light use.
0000031887,2.0,It gets stars because it's gorgeous (very full, a nice rich purple) and is soft.  But maybe a play tutu ought to be made out of slightly more substantial material and sewn with stronger thread.  My daughter was just dancing around (not pulling at it) and it got a big hole in it at the top seam.  I'll fix it, but I bought it precisely so I wouldn't have to sew one!
0000031887,5.0,I used it for my 8 MONTH old. I wanted it a little shorter so I cut about 2 inches off. I think she would be able to wear it for a long time because the waist band is stretchy and it was a little loose.
0000031887,4.0,For the money, I got exactly what I paid for.  It is perfect for my 4 year old daughter.  She loves it.
0000031887,5.0,Really cute skirt. Very good quality for a ballet style skirt. I am required to write 4 more words, now just one.
0000031887,4.0,We really like my daughters tutu. It's simple, but elegant! I would like more colors!  I would buy another for sure
0000031887,5.0,My granddaughter loves to wear this.  The waist band is soft and comfortable.  Have not had to wash it yet, so don't know how it will launder.
0000031887,5.0,I bought this for my four year old niece with some fairy wings.  She loved it and would not take it off until bedtime.  It is nice fabric and fit her perfectly!
0000031887,4.0,I bought this tutu for my granddaughter. She loves wearing tutus and I liked the variety of colors available. The price is reasonable and if it gets damaged I'm happy knowing she had joy hours of enjoyment!
0000031887,5.0,My daughter has worn this skirt almost every day since she received it and it's even been through the washer along with the other clothes.  It's amazing quality!  She fits a 4T and it's just above her knee, and has a little bit of growing room, although I'm not so sure as much as others are saying.  But considering how often she wears it, I'm not worried! ;)
0000031887,5.0,I ordered this purple tutu for my daughter's first birthday. It was so fun and cute! It was obviously a little big on her because she was only a year old, but the elastic worked well enough and she will be able to wear it for many more birthdays to come. It came to her feet like a dress but didn't drag or trip her at all. I was able to wash it on a regular cycle (I just put it in a lingerie bag to be safe) and tumbled it on low. Great & fun item!
0000031887,5.0,I bought this Tutu for my 7 year old daughters Diva party. She loved it and it looked sooo cute on!It is not flimsy at all a great value for the price. I would buy more in different colors!
0000031887,5.0,We originally bought this for my daughter's Halloween costume and it was as bright, cute and fluffy as it looks in the picture. (Once you fluff if out of the package.) It's been a constant favorite of my daughter ever since.  She's worn it for parties and play time.  It's been stuffed in toy-boxes and left on floor and it is still holding up perfectly.  The waistband is stretchy enough to fit a larger child but still stays snug on a 4 yr old (now 5). Great value for the price.
0000031887,3.0,Tutus were great for holiday dance show and what we needed them for. They were shipped very quickly and came very neat, no need to steam them. Fits younger girls and small waisted teens.
0000031887,5.0,My granddaughter wears a tutu just about every day.  I like this one because it's shaped just right and is PLAIN.  Some of the ones I see in the stores are hideous, so gaudy.  heh, although she wears them just as proudly. I sent this one to her for her birthday and saw her on skype dancing and twirling.  Mission accomplished.
0000031887,5.0,great tutu for my daughter to play dress up in. she loves this and will stay in it most of the day haha. it is not too tight and not too short great for playing and twirling.
0000031887,4.0,We bought this for our two and a half year old daughter for Valentines Day. Its a lot thinner then I thought, but very cute. No cleaning instructions.
0000031887,3.0,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter. It's a nice red tutu but it's not what I wanted. It was a little too short for my taste and I'm not sure if I like the way it fits her. I haven't decided if I wanna use it or not. :-(
0000031887,5.0,Item was exactly what I was looking for.  Girls loved their Christmas gift !. . .  would buy again from this vendor.
0000031887,5.0,Absolutely love this tutu. Fit my little girl perfectly (she's a size 4t) Arrived super quick - just in time for a Halloween party & just in time to replace a &#34;no-show&#34; costume. It ended being a huge hit & I actually ended up liking it even more than my original purchase.
0000031887,5.0,I was pleasantly suprised when the package arrived - high quality craftsmanship, enough layers of tuling to really fluff and keep what is underneath covered.  The price was a steal - I will definately purchase this line in the future for gifts.
0000031887,5.0,I got this for my daughter who is now 2 years and 4 months old. Her weight is in the lower 25th percentile, but she is tall for her age. This tutu fit her well on the waist, and the length came to her knees, which was perfect. The color is very pretty and the waist band is sewed well. My daughter specifically wanted a blue tutu, and this was the best deal I found in the small size and Prime eligible.
0000031887,5.0,We bought this for our 2 year old and she LOVES the color. The tutu is very full on her and she loves how it flies when she twirls. It has a bright satin band with the elastic underneath, which helps the elastic not annoy her sensitive skin.Our daughter is very small so I was afraid it might be to big, but it stays up and isn't to long on her!
0000031887,4.0,This was a good purchase, seems to be well made and also fuller than I had anticipated - good gift to add to alreadypurchased  Christmas gifts for grand daughter :)
0000031887,5.0,I bought a white tutu. My 4 year old daughter loves it. It looks very beautiful and graceful on her.
0000031887,5.0,I was very impressed with the tutus. Very good quality. Excellent price! .....and the girls absolutely loved them! They looked fabulous!
0000031887,5.0,Purchased this tutu for my granddaughter's first birthday.  It fit nicely with room to grow in.  I'm very please with it and will purchase more in varying colors in the future.
0000031887,5.0,Bought this for my 3 1/2 yo daughter for Christmas for dress up. She loves it! Good quality. Very poofy, frilly and girly!
0000031887,2.0,I was impressed when I first opened the package.  Very cute!  However, either it is not well made or my toddler is extra hard on it because it has unraveled in a short amount of time.  I would not buy this again.
0000031887,4.0,I just bought this for a halloween costume and it got to my house within 4 days!! I was very happy about that! I took a star down because it is a LITTLE bit see through but not very much. It very good for ages 5-12
0000031887,3.0,while i understand i should pay more attention to product description. i was in a hurry online shopping and searched multiple tutus for 2 year old. I saw this picture and assumed it came with all of them. and when i received one i had to go back and read that it was only the lavender. mostly my fault but maybe product pic should only show the one color you are choosing..
0000031887,5.0,I got this tutu for for halloween for my baby girl and she loved it. It arrived fast and in perfect condition!
0000031887,2.0,Tutu fits a little tight and the quality is not the best. Beautiful color though. I would not purchase again.
0000031887,4.0,Received the red tutu late, I needed it to accessorize a Halloween costume.  My 6yr.old loved it though, she wore it immediately and wouldn't take it off.  She wore it with a pair of leggings and a leopard tank top.  It is really cute.
0000031887,5.0,I got this in pink and white for a slender 2 year old. It is a little on the loose side, but it does stay on. While my little girl is a bit of a tomboy, as she is overshadowed by 5 older brothers, she does enjoy wearing this over her jeggings and running around and playing. Her playdates, two who are closer to 3, are madly in love with the tutus--it's a good thing we only have one of them at a time. I think that it would ideally fit a 3 or 4 year old without any stretch, but could fit kids possibly up to the age of twelve with the amount of stretch it has. The elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft. After throwing it in the wash, the edges can curl a little with minimal fray--maybe I could have put it on a gentler cycle, but it looks pretty much lithe same. I really like the way the elastic is sewn in. The satin edge is part of the tulle fabric, not sewn on, and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge, making it seem pretty secure. I have made my own tutus, but they never looked as nice or were so soft.
0000031887,5.0,good price and just what I wanted. My granddaughters have thoroughly enjoyed them. They play with them nearly every day.
0000031887,5.0,Delievered quickly.  Really cute and better quality than I expected considering the reasonable price.  I would recommend this tutu to others.
0000031887,5.0,Pefect!! My 4 year old boy loves wearing it. We bought it for a parade where we were all going to be water fairies and he alternates between that and being the best butterfly ever!! Color is gorgeous, cleans up well after food spills and waistband seems very hearty! Can also double as a fun headcovering for adults.
0000031887,5.0,Full and well stitched.  This tutu is a beautiful purple color that looks just like the picture.  It looks just adorable on our little fairy.
0000031887,5.0,I bought this for a 4-5 year old for Christmas for dressing up. It was a big hit. She loved it
0000031887,4.0,It fits my daughter great and serves it's purpose wonderfully! She wears it all the time! I would recommend this skirt.
0000031887,5.0,This was a gift for a two year old and a five year old.  The girls squealed upon opening the box, they grabbed the tutus, put them on, and wore them the rest of the day.  The tutus seem to be well made, and can stand up to handling by little princesses.  I recommend these tutus.
0000031887,5.0,I bought this for my baby cousin and she never had a tutu before this was a great first tutu and fit perfect according to the size we got.
0000031887,5.0,This was perfect for my son's 4 year old friend for her birthday.  Perfect for dress up or to wear over shorts or pants.  Price point was perfect too!
0000031887,4.0,Great tutu for the price.  Not as fluffy as I would have thought.  It is a beautiful purple color, though.
0000031887,4.0,So cute and fluffier than i expected. Wish it came in my size. The waist band is a little weird so i gave it 4 stars. It doesnt lay flat.
0000031887,4.0,Love the tutu fast shipping looks like a well made Tutu and you can't bet the price. My little girl loved it.
0000031887,5.0,Really great price for easy dress up play.  The colors are fun and vibrant.  Easy on and off. What more does one want in a tu-tu?
0000031887,4.0,I would buy this again for the price, but I didn't like how the waist wasn't stitched down like a waistband...the top of the tulle is covered well, but I thought it would have a flat waistband.
0000031887,5.0,We bought this tutu as part of my daughter's halloween costume.  Love that she can now use it to dress up and to wear to her dance class.  The best feature of this tutu is the layers...not so flimsy that you can see through it.  Like that it keeps my daughter a little more covered up!
0000031887,3.0,My 3yr old loved this tutu skirt in pink! Was hoping to order more in different colors.She had hardly used this,the stitching came apart in 2weeks.now it's lying in her closet..Altogether she wore it like 4-5 times for 20 mins or so.wish the stitching was of better quality to hold up while little ones wear it. Can't recommend.
0000031887,5.0,Perfect for my budding grand daughter ballerina! Beautiful vibrant color.  Fits great and easy to  clean!  I bought several more colors!
0000031887,5.0,I ordered these tutus for my boyfriends daughter, she loves them! I was scared they would not be very full because when they arrived they were packaged very small. But as soon as I opened the plastic they filled out beautifully. Since most toddler tutus are around $40, I was very pleased I got these under $10. Great for playing dress up!
0000031887,4.0,My neice loved it. She is a dress-up kind of girl and loved adding the tutu to her collection. Was upset that it didn't specify only one tutu is sold at a time unless you specify quantity...I thought it came as a set.
0000031887,1.0,After only wearing the skirt once by my daughter, the stitching at the waist has already come undone.  I would return the product but the shipping would cost more than the skirt.
0000031887,5.0,This was a costume for an adult at an elementary school.  The kids loved it, it fit great for an adult, and seems very sturdy for future uses.
0000031887,1.0,Never GOT this item - but gave a 1 STAR because the replies from the SUPPLIER was GREAT.They tried to send the item more than once.My $ was refunded in a timely manner too.It was a shame I never got it for my daughter - it would of looked great with her OUTFIT for Dr. Seuss WEEK at school.Most original.Maybe next time.
0000031887,5.0,Perfect!!Teal tutu for 2nd birthday outfit! Loved it! Thought the color matched perfectly with her &#34;I am 2&#34; t-shirt and her leggings!
0000031887,3.0,I ordered 26 tutus for a school production.  After 19 days and 4 e-mails (only 1 answered) I finally recieved them.  This company is a joke.  I spoke with a representative from the company before making the purchase and she was going to refund some costs because I ordered a large quantity.  Of course that never happened. After 2 weeks and the tracking of the package never changing, I began to attempt to contact.  After 2 unanswered e-mails, she responded,&#34; I thought these were for a Christmas play?  You still have time.&#34;  What??? That is not the point.  I needed them for  a meeting to discuss the costumes.  She then said the package had been lost- really??? She never shipped them.  When I did receive the package the skirts were stuffed in a paper towel box with out even an invoice, piece of plastic around them or anything. Skirts were fine.  The company is lacking in every way.
0000031887,5.0,Nice and puffy tutu skirt. I would recommend this for girls under 10 yr. old.  It will be too short and small for older girls.
0000031887,5.0,Absolutely darling! Only issue is that it is a different blue than the picture. But that is not a problem.
0000031887,4.0,This is great for use as a dance costume, for play, or even as part of a party outfit. It fits my daughter who wears 3t now and has plenty of room to stretch, so she will probably be able to wear it for a few years.  If worn in public a leotard, thick tights or leggings will be needed.
0000031887,5.0,Perfect party favor my my daughters tutu cute party! I ordered 4 purple turus for each of her friends to wear ranging in age 1 1/2-6 and they all loved them!
0000031887,5.0,im 18 with a 32 inch waist it was great.It was a little tight but i didnt mind and the price was great and it was worth to be used
0000031887,5.0,This is exactly what I needed to make my 8 year old daughter's Halloween costume more full in appearance.  It arrived quickly and fit her well.
0000031887,5.0,This was a gift for my 2 year old niece. The waist fit just right and the elastic will let her wear it for quite a long time. I was afraid it would be long and saggy on her because she's so small, but I was happy to see the length was perfect and it was quite fluffy. Will be looking to buy more in other colors!
0000031887,1.0,We got this for my daughter for Christmas, she has only worn it a few times this week, its only new years now and it is completely unraveling! The material is so cheap, I can't even sew it back on, it would just unravel again, I had to completely remake it! Not worth it, very disappointed!
0000031887,5.0,greatgrand daughters love them, put them on the minute they got them. I was really happy they loved them all
0000031887,1.0,When i was purchasing this item i was under the impression that i was going to recieve all colors of the tutus but when i just recieved my package i only recieved 1!!!!! there was no where i could pick my color so thats why i figured it came with all the colors. the picture is false advertisment showing all colors and then when you get your package you only get one!!
0000031887,5.0,this is a great tutu for a smaller child! nicely made, great buy for 7 bucks! i am happy with my purchase
0000031887,5.0,The item was perfect for my 3 year old granddaughter who is taking her first ballet class.  Materials were good and the item came quickly.  Great price.
0000031887,2.0,Unfortunately this skirts elastic is not stretchy enough to accommodate the 2-9 yr old range., This is CRAZY!!  I would say it only stretches through about 1 size..  I would throw this in a costume play chest (with a safety pin handy) and call it a day
0000031887,5.0,Great price, and it came within a reasonable amount of time. If I ever need any additional Tutu's I would buy them from this company.
0000031887,4.0,I was right....girls still like to dress up in net skirts. I bought my granddaughter three of these tutus and she has one on just about every day. She is not quite three and has a tiny waist, and skirt fits her fine, so I don't know if it would work for anyone over about 4-5 years. It's fairly well made...not great but pretty good. The waistband may give out eventually...as it gets very twisted every time she takes it off. But it's a great value, because she plays with it more than most of her other toys.
0000031887,1.0,Was really cute when I received it. Washed it on a gentle cycle because my grand daughter has severe allergies and the entire thing came apart. Needed it for a school production and had to handstich the waistband back together. Would not buy again.
0000031887,4.0,I'm a 21yo male. Waist 30-31, 150lbs and it fits me just fine. Just a little tight getting it around my thighs but it fits just fine. Bought it for a Halloween costume. Very pleased. Order oct 17th. Shipped oct 22nd. Delivered oct 25th
0000031887,5.0,Love it and my daughter loves it--perfect for dress up or even to wear out. It's affordable and a hit!
0000031887,4.0,Really cute tutu at a bargain price! My 12yr old daughter used it for a Minnie mouse costume. We were really happy with the purchase and only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it arrived a couple days later than promised date.
0000031887,5.0,Bought this for my niece as part of her fairy outfit.  She loves it and wears it all the time.  Well made for the price.
0000031887,5.0,I'm really happy with the quality of this tutu, the satin waistband was a lovely touch, and I was happily surprised at the many layers of tulle, this is not a cheaply made tutu! This is a perfect present for my niece, thanks!
0000031887,5.0,We purchased a black tutu.  My 5 year old and 2 year old can both where it!  They love how 'fancy' it is and I love how cute it is!
0000031887,5.0,This is such a cute skirt.  It seems flimsy and small when you take it out of the package, but once my five-year-old put it on, I could see that it was perfect.  It's just what it looks like and will likely fit smaller and larger than her 5T size.
0000031887,5.0,I bought this for my 2 year old niece for Christmas. My sister-in-law told me that she wears it every night before she goes to bed. She is really into the color pink right now, the fuchsia tutu was a big hit for her.
0000031887,5.0,Bought as part of a Christmas gift for 4 year old niece. She's big into ballet and dance and just loved this! It's very fluffy and full and since it has an elastic waist it is something she can wear now and into the future. This was about knee length on her. This would also make a cute piece for a costume. Would recommend!
0000031887,5.0,I bought this tutu for my daughter as a piece for her Halloween costume! As soon as she got she wore the heck out of it!, it is as cute as can be!
0000031887,5.0,In my three years old and I loved this tutu. It looks beautiful, good quality, I'm perfect :) I loved it
0000031887,2.0,Not a great purchase. I bought this for my four year old. It was a little tight and cheaply made. It will not be long for this world. She is happy with it, but she doesn't know better. I would not recommend.
0000031887,5.0,I ordered this tutu for my three year-old niece who loves to dress up as a ballerina. I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality of the fabric and it has held up very well through her many costume changes. ;)I would definitely recommend this item to others.
0000031887,3.0,Well, the color that it stated that it was, it was NOT!  The color was more a sea-green color not really turquoise.  This was cute for the price but I failed to look and see that this tutu was not lined.  Boo!  I got this to use as part of an outfit.  However, had it been just for dress up it was fine and priced ok.
0000031887,5.0,This tutu worked well for a halloween costume. Pretty well made and a great buy for the cost. Just be aware that the dye lots can be quite different. I ordered two for matching costumes and one was a dark purple and the other was almost a lavender purple.
0000031887,5.0,I gave this to my 2 year old niece for xmas and she loves it.  My sister says that it's pretty sturdy too so well worth it.
0000031887,5.0,My daughter uses these for dance lessons. We have ordered a few different colors because they are so inexpensive. They're holding up well. My only complaint is that one has to watch being charged separate shipping on each item.
0000031887,5.0,I put it on my two year old and it fit great. I put it on myself and it fit as well and I'm 25. Very elastic and bounces right back.
0000031887,5.0,This is great tutu at a very reasonable price! I would definitely buy again. My 4 yr old daughter loves it!
0000031887,5.0,I bought this TuTu for a Halloween costume. I was hesitant because of not seeing it before buying it and all the cheap ones in the stores for Halloween. I am really glad I did. It lasted through 4 parties and 2 nights of Trick or Treating. It is still in great condition to keep with all the dress up clothes. I don't think it was made for a ballet uniform because it doesn't look that "straight" at the bottom.I highly recommend and plan on buying more colors.
0000031887,5.0,Love this tu tu for my 2-1/2 year old.  A little longer than what I was expecting, but the elastic waist is durable and tight enough for her, a very good purchasing especially with free shipping.
0000031887,5.0,My 4 year old daughter always wants to play dress up. I bought this for her for Christmas and she never wanted to take it off. It is almost a year later and she still has it!! It was well worth the money and has held up this long with nothing wrong with it!! I would recommend it
0000031887,5.0,My granddaughter loved the tutu, it was a gift w a dance stage her grandfather made her. The color was great as well
0000031887,1.0,The product I received is very cheaply made and a waste of money! I opened the package, which did come quickly in the mail, to find a skirt with a single layer of tool, folded in half and sewn together at the top. No other layers then that. There are some rose petals in the middle of the folded tool and a cheap looking rose glued to the front, with excess glue dripping on the petals. It also clearly says " Made in China " on the tag. It's such poor quality, I feel completely ripped off! If I saw this in a store I would NOT buy it, but if I had to, I wouldn't spend more then $3.00.
0000031887,5.0,My Niece loved it & still hasn't taken it off since Xmas! Perfect gift for a lil girl who loves to dress up!
0000031887,5.0,my granddaughter was twirling within seconds of  opening this gift. It was very well made and should last a while, unless she never takes it off.  By the way she is only  3 and said &#34; I will now dance&#34; .I would definitely recommend this I item.
0000031887,5.0,Ordered this for Christmas.  My little girl was trilled.  It fit very well.  She was dancing around the whole room.  Shipping was very fast.  It was a great gift.
0000031887,5.0,Bought my 5 yr old daughter these for xmas, and she wears them once a week to dance and they have held up very well.. Very happy with product, will buy more in the future!!
0000031887,2.0,This item is a lot smaller than expected and although the description says fits up to a 6x this is definitely not the case. I was disappointed.
0000031887,5.0,I purchased this for my grand daughter who is almost 2 and she loves it!  I am pleased with the quality and the price. The delivery was prompt also.
0000031887,5.0,My granddaughter loves her tutu!!  She feels like a princess!  It is very study so I don't have to worry about it falling apart! Very cute!
0000031887,5.0,It was as described and fit my 3 year old grand daughter perfectly. She loves to play dress-up and this is a good addition to her wardrobe. I received the item quickly and the packaging was great.
0000031887,5.0,Our granddaughters are all very girlie, so when the youngest one received this for Christmas, they all wanted it!  Great color and fit for a 2 year old as well as her aunt who is 30!  I would recommend this tutu for all little girls.
0000031887,5.0,I BBOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER, SHE LOVES IT AND WEARS IT EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS. THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL AND I WOULD SURELY BUY IT AGAIN.
0000031887,2.0,you guys should have warned a sista that this tutu is for kids. i didn't know this until i ordered it. Now i got a childs tutu and don't know what to do with it!
0000031887,5.0,I bought 2 of these for my grandaughters to wear (as required)as flowergirls in a wedding. They were perfect! Very well made. The other flowergirls parents asked where did we get them. The others bought their girls at a ballet store and were quite pricey & not near the quality. I/we are extremely happy with them & highly recommend them to anyone who needs to buy an excellent tutu.
0000031887,2.0,I choose this rating because I received the item damaged, the item stated that it would fit a older child.  The item will fit a child ages 2-5.The item was received when in stated.
0000031887,4.0,Love how full it is! After wearing it almost all day for her party my daughter's tutu was already fraying along the bottom... Still worth the buy.
0000031887,5.0,These little skirts are just adroable! The colors are bright and they are made with nice material. I got 3 colors and they are all beautiful.
0000031887,5.0,My daughters love their pink tutus. And for only $2, who can resist? Puffy and fluffy with a sateen waistband. Perfect.
0000031887,1.0,IF I could give it lower I would... The skirt did not ship for over a week and I had ordered it for my daughters birthday needless to say it did not make it.  I actually never got it so I will never order anything from these people again.
0000031887,5.0,This tutu is a great quality buy. Especially for such a low price. I don't know why the other colors were more expensive
0000031887,5.0,I was looking for a tutu that could be the starting point for a collection of "dress-up clothes" for my daughter. This tutu was affordably priced and seems very well-constructed. My daughter immediately wanted to start wearing it, and enjoys it a lot. I would definitely consider buying additional colors.
0000031887,5.0,I thought this would be cheaply made because of the price, but I am surprised. The trim around the waist is a silk/satin material that is soft on the skin. I bought this for a 3 year old and she fits in it and will continue to fit in it for awhile.
0000031887,1.0,Not very good quality, be more specific in size wise because it will not fit everyone, also it is too thin and not what i expected
0000031887,4.0,Prompt delivery, and it is exactly as described.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven't washed it yet- so I don't know how it will hold up... Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus (we got one in light pink also), especially spinning and running in them :)  She's on the little side, so my concern was that it would be too big, but the fit is perfect!  The elastic waist will expand with her as she grows.
0000031887,5.0,My 3-year old granddaughter loves it!  I also got her a ballerina costume for her Bitty Baby. Definitely a big hit!
0000031887,5.0,I purchased this as a part of the &#34;Princess&#34; t-shirt dress I'm making for my granddaughter.  It's exactly the color pictured and it's very soft.
0000031887,5.0,This was a gift for my grand kids, they love it, and will not take it off not even to wash it.
0000037214,1.0,Way smaller. Fits infant but not up to 7 my daughter wears a 4-5t and it was tight on her had to give it away so didn't even wear it
0123456479,5.0,Very simple...I love it because she loves it. She like the pink color; its a nice, worm and clean pink color...Doesnt look cheap at all.
0123456479,5.0,This was  my granddaughter 's Christmas present, and I am told she is very happy with it. Keeps all her jewelry in one place now.
0123456479,4.0,I was looking for a perfect jewelry box that can organize my collection and found this one after checking online and in stores. I purchased this primarily because the picture caught my eye and the glowing reviews. Well, I'm not dissappointed when I received it. The box is huge alright, and the many compartments is really helpful in organizing your jewelry, it is well designed. I gave it 4 stars only because it is not heirloom material. If only they constructed it in wood with a nice finish and same lined interior, it would be perfect. As it is, I'd say it is priced a bit too high.
0123456479,5.0,I absolutely LOVE this box :) It's got so much space for all my jewellery and is the perfect soft, pink color. The little travelling case is also very practical and has enough space for your favourite jewellery. I would highly recommend this product.
0123456479,5.0,This was a gift for special young lady who loves jewelry and loves pink! She loves this jewelry box with all of its little compartments and special spaces for her jewelry.
0123456479,4.0,I love the product and liked that it is of a good size. Big enough to hold enough of my jewelry. It holds alot of my jewelry, however, I gave it four stars because I would have liked it even better if my necklaces were able to fit on the two side doors. the pins are too short so I either had to wrap my necklaces multiple times or store them in one of the other compartments.
0123456479,5.0,This was everything as advertised,it is exactaly what I was looking for. I got it for my eight year old grand daughter and she loves it and it will last for many years.
0123456479,5.0,This jewelry box is just right for my small collection of jewelry as each compartment is exactly what I needed.
0123456479,5.0,I have ordered this for my friends daughter and it is the perfect size pink leather jewelry box. It is very good quality and looks exactly the same. I am very satisfied with the product and with Shining Image. I got the product in a very good shape and on time.
0123456479,4.0,This is a nice jewelry organizer but it's far from being &#34;huge&#34;.  It's an attractive item so despite my disappointment at the size I decided to keep it and use it practically on a daily basis.  I guess next time I order I'll pay more attention to the dimensions.
0123456479,5.0,The minute I saw this my heart skipped a beat. What a nice case to sort my collection. I love all the compartments and the layout too. You will love this color too. If this is a gift do not hesitate. It will please even the most fussy, as I am. The price is fair if you check around as I did. Seems well made too. It is suitable for an adult though. Not meant as a toy. This is for serious jewelry lover's. Buy it.....
0123456479,5.0,This jewelry box is of cute color and good quality. It provides plenty of slots to put in different kinds of jewels. Additionally, there is a small travel-size jewelry box. With it, it is easy to carry my favorite braceletes and necklaces when traveling.
0123456479,4.0,I love pink, and this box is a beautiful shade of it. The handle makes it very convenient to pick up and carry to the dressing table or bed. All closed up, it's just as cute as can be. I'm very pleased with the overall looks of it. I've never had hanging storage for my necklaces before, and I do like this feature. The only fault I find is with the earring storage area that has plastic inserts. Nine holes per insert, which means I'd have to separate one pair. Having to attach the earrings through the holes is bothersome, too, and the plastic is just ugly. I'd much rather just have the little divided spaces to drop the earrings into.  I've removed the inserts (they just slide up and out) and am using the space for something else.I'm not sure how useful the little travel box will be, but it's cute, and it's kind of neat that it will fit right into the box or can be left out and that space used to store something else. I was a bit shocked when I started looking at jewelry storage prices, and I believe this item gives a lot of good storage for the money. And, (can I say it again?) it's just so darned cute - at least in pink!
0123456479,5.0,This was a great find. All my jewels are in one spot and can take and go when ever I need to.  Couldn't be happier.
0123456479,4.0,This is probably the best and most efficient jewelry box I've ever owned. It's pretty pink color and padded leathery lushness is all I needed to make me feed my inner rainbow and ponies-loving little girl. It has tons of room and is very well equipped to store quite a bit of jewelry. If it has one flaw, the main clasp on mine is a bit hard to latch. I think it comes in other colors if you're one whom pink does not speak to ;)
0123456479,5.0,Love this Jewelry Box  so well put together holds plendy... Love the pink & looks so nice on my vanity.
0123456479,5.0,I got this jewelry box for one of my granddaughters (7 yrs. old) for Christmas. She loves it! It has lots and lots of drawers and spaces to put all her special jewelry. She likes the little removable box that she can take with her. It was just what she wanted.
0123456479,5.0,This products is great for anyone with a lot of jewelry my girlfriend has a lot and this gift for her was one of my best ideas! i recommend this to any one with a lot of jewelry
0123456479,3.0,I already own this particular Shining Image jewelry box in brown, so this was my second buy. It arrived with some of the leather scratched, even though it looked like I was the first one opening the box. This particular color pink also looked pretty bad in person. The quality of this box seemed lesser than the brown one I own.I returned this pink case for a refund without a problem.  Got another brown Shining Image jewelry case and it's fine!
0123456479,5.0,I love this jewelry box. It's absolutely amazing. There's room for everything you could possibly imagine. It even comes with a key that is used for locking up the jewelry box if wanted but if you don't want to you can just close it shut. This is literally one of my best purchases. Hope this makes everyone's decisions easier.
0123456479,5.0,Perfect gift for a little miss who loves jewelery and Pink! Jewelery box has lots ocof compartments and I'm sure she is going to love it.
0123456479,5.0,Loved this jewelry box.  it was a gift for my Granddaughter,  She loved it and being younger (11) she loved the color
0123456479,5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter, who will be five soon. After I got done inspecting it- I said " I did good!". I think she will love it. Lots of compartments of various sizes and dividers. I thought the quality was excellent! I can expect she will have and enjoy this for many years. Read instructions the 1st time you open it 1st. Great value, and very well made.
0123456479,5.0,Highly recommendable product! Loved itDon't think twice just go n buy w/o any hitch. Complete Feminine Make up box
0123456479,5.0,Very nice jewelry box. It has many different compartments with space for many different types of jewelry. It all packs neatly into a portable case. I bought it for my young granddaughter, and I expect it could last her for a very long time. It is suitable for a young girl or for an adult. The order was filled very promptly.
0123456479,5.0,I got this as a gift and I couldn't ask for anything more. I've been looking for a great jewelry box for years and this is perfect- spacious, great organization, and good looking. I love it, couldn't be happier. I definitely reccomend buying it.
0123456479,5.0,Order this for my niece.  It is a very nice jewelry case that will grow with her as her jewelry collection grows.
0123456479,5.0,I have a similar box for myself, and my daughter wanted one for her birthday.  So I got this one and she loves it.  Great gift.
0123456479,5.0,This is a great jewelry box. Definitely has a lot of room and a lot of little boxes/spaces. I couldnt be happier with it. It accompanies me on all my travels.
0123456479,5.0,I got this jewelry box for a young lady and her favorite color is pink.  She loved it.  I was very glad I purchased this.
0123456479,5.0,This jewelry box is perfect for my daughter. She is 8 years old and needed something secure enough to keep her little brother out. This jewelry box is just perfect for that task. I'm so happy with my purchase.
0123456479,5.0,This was a great gift for a preteen!Easy to use and organize all her jewelry.I know she will use it for years to come!
0123456479,4.0,this box is elegant and completely functional, I guess my only complaint, which is my fault, is that all the compartments are quite small.  If you have chunky jewelry like my wife has then this box cannot accommodate your jewelry. other than that its fantastic
0123456479,4.0,I received the pink jewelry box yesterday and I love the color and it doesn't seem cheap to me at all, although the "traveling box" inside did not want to open so I had to take scissors to it to even get it opened. But I didn't need that because I bought this as a traveling jewelry case. I would say this is a good jewelry box for children or for those who only have fine jewelry. But if you have a lot of costume bling jewelry like me this isn't made to hold all of your jewelry. All of the jewelry I am taking with me on vacation fit but my necklaces and I had to do a few rearrangments with my bracelets. So now I have to come up with a different way to travel with my necklace collection. But over all this is a good product and the smell they speak of is just the new smell and my husband was surprised at all I could fit in but like I said I took the small travel case out and had to rearrange a lot of my bracelets and bling earrings. Good for traveling case and childrens jewelry case. This product is not for permanant home use for a complete collection of costume bling jewelry. Oh, yes the necklace holders can only hold small necklace chains.
0123456479,4.0,The box is GREAT in the inside, but lacked more detail and or creativeness on the outside. Overall a 4 star. thank you
0123456479,4.0,I just received this item today-I ordered it Monday night!  I am very pleased with it, and it does look better in person.  I gave it four out of five stars due to the little plastic inserts located on the top right rear section of the jewelry box, which had a weird smudged coating on it that I tried to clean off.  I ended up not using them, since I needed the room, and the inserts were only in the way.
0123456479,5.0,I got this as a gift for my GKid and she loves it.  Her jewelry was every where in her room so now she can keep it all together.  Plus she loves the take-with-you piece.  When she comes to visit she can bring a couple of items and know they are secure.  I am thinking about getting one my some of my jewelry.
0123456479,5.0,Lots of room for jewelry! There are many compartments! I love the pink leather. It also has a cute travel jewelry box that I use while going away for small necklaces and earrings. I especially love the side openings that hang necklaces!
0123456479,3.0,Bought this for my daughter and It is very nice, the only thing is the lock did not work, other than that it is made very solid.
0123456479,5.0,I ordered this for my niece's fifth birthday.  She just got her ears pierced and has a few pieces of real jewelry that are nice.  I knew she was getting some earrings for her birthday and would need a place to keep them.  I love this because it is a real jewelry box, but has lots of great features for a little girl too.  The mirror is great, the pale pink color is great and the flip open sides are great as well.  There is tons of storage so she can use it for years to come and even as a teenager without being embarrassed by cartoon artwork that she was into as a child (I almost got a Disney princess one, but thought better of it).  She could even use this as an adult and keep it for her daughter since its made of leather and is well constructed.  The little removable box is great for travel and she's already used it to come visit us for the Fourth of July!  The travel box has a place to slide a little plastic panel with holes in it for earrings!  I am very happy with this purchase and my bling loving, mature niece loves it too.  She feels like a big girl and now I can help her fill it up every birthday and Christmas!  It's a win-win!
0123456479,1.0,Bought this for my wife, was a little disappointed by the appearance, "leather" looks very cheap and is tacky. Most importantly, the two buttons holding the side pockets fell apart on first use, so now the sides flap around anytime the box is moved around.Would most certainly never buy this item again, because I did not expect such a poor quality from reading all previous reviews. My wife is happy though as it has plenty of space, but I feel like I wasted a lot of money and should have looked around (and maybe paid) more to get something that lasts a little longer than 10 minutes.
0123456479,4.0,Lots of little compartments to keep your jewelry from becoming entangled. Very Easy to clean exterior. Also the perfect color.
0123456479,5.0,Purchased for my granddaughter 11 yrs old.  I was very surprised at how beautiful this is.  Suitable for an adult.  I may get one for myself.
0123456479,3.0,Gave this as a gift to a pre-teen.  She loves it. However I do have to agree with some people that certain areas of this box were poorly made.  I noticed seems pulling apart - just when I received it and opened it to check on it. I re-glued them, but the initial job was poor and considering that I'd say a bit overpriced for what it is.
0123456479,3.0,I wanted to have the title summarize my thoughts if you decide not to read the entire review.  My granddaughter likes the Shining Image Jewelry Box given to her for a birthday gift from Grandma.  I wish the drawers were deeper for holding her many necklaces.  Also, I wish the drawers had a stop, preventing the drawers from tipping contents entirely when trying to remove one piece of jewelry.  My granddaughter is only five years old, so having the background knowledge of knowing when to stop the action of pulling the drawer from the base requires practice.  I, on the other hand, have had lacks of years of practice with jewelry drawers, but also struggle with removing the drawer without spilling the contents.
0123456479,5.0,This box holds all my jewelry in one place, so many compartments in a very  portable case, I am very happy with the case and the price is good.
0123456479,5.0,The colour is cute and the box is better than I was expecting. The only problem  is that it is a little bit heavy so it is not the best option if you want to use it when you travel by plane which has a limited baggage option.
0123456479,5.0,Received this item in two business days. It looks exactly like the picture. Big box with a lot of spaces to put jewlery, but slots and drawers are kinda small. But I didnt mind at all since I don't wear big jwelery. Material is very nice also.
0123456479,5.0,It wont last a lifetime but it is cute and serves it purpose. It has many spaces to put jewelry! very cute!
0123456479,3.0,The lock/latch on this is pretty chintzy, and overall it is a pretty cheaply made. But I purchased this for a young teen, and she liked it well enough, probably owing to the fact that bubble gum pink is her favorite color.
0123456479,3.0,It is a pretty box but not so useful.  The drawers fall out if you pull them too far .
0123456479,4.0,Very nice storage and organizer.  I did, however, expect it to be a bit larger.  It is very heavy duty and a nice way to protect jewelry.
0123456479,5.0,Nice piece, but thought it appeared bigger in photo.  It works fine.  I could have had some knobs on the bottem to stand on because we wanted to use it in the bathroom and it gets moist in there.  Water under the box would have started mold.  We use in the bedroom instead.  Great piece.
0123456479,5.0,I bought this jewelry box for my granddaughter! She was having problems putting her jewelry away and always losing some. So I bought this for her. She absolutely loves it and so far, has been putting her jewelry away!
0123456479,5.0,Best jewlery box of all time !!! It is huge and it closes up well Nd comes with a key and has so much compartments for my jewlery which is amazing for me because I am a major jewelry girl lol not to mention the box is so elegant and beautiful i really think it is worth it especially if you have a lot of jewlery to organize .
0123456479,5.0,I purchased this gift for my daughter over a year ago for her 7th birthday.  She loves the jewelry box and does really well and keeping everything organized.  It offers a lot of storage options.
0123456479,5.0,This is awesome! Tons of space, very classy, cute as can be. You will not be disappointed what-so-ever. Great quality. Looks wonderful in my closet.
0123456479,4.0,This is a Awesome Jewelery Box where i can store All of my jewellery. and very easy to access for daily wear also. I gave the 4 stars because i got cherry color one instead of Pink though i loved it.
0123456479,5.0,This jewelry box is truly a good purchase.  It is spacious and of great quality.  While my grandchild was thrilled with this gift the adults who saw it said, " I would like to have that for my own!"
0123456479,4.0,I had read a review from someone who had purchased three of these boxes for her nieces.  She stated that she thought this box might be intended for the younger set.  Well, maybe she's right. Maybe I'm just extra young at heart! I love my new jewelry box. I even bought it in the pink (it comes in black and camel). It is roomy and holds lots of pieces within a relatively compact case. It has lots of room for earrings. That is primarily what I own. I don't wear rings, and I only have a handful of necklaces and chains. It also has an absolutely adorable carrying case for travel. This jewelry box also has a mirror under the lid and the whole case folds up and locks securely! I love it!  Before I bought this, I had kept my jewelry in an assortment of little ceramic boxes that cluttered up my dresser.  Now, all is consolidated into a single, attractive case that fits nicely on my dresser. I am very satisfied with my choice.  I might add that I looked at almost every jewelry case that Amazon offered and I kept coming back to this one. The price was right and the product is wonderful.  Don't be misled by the color in the pictures.  The color I purchased (the pink) is even prettier than depicted.
0123456479,5.0,Bought it for a christmas present for my granddaughter. She loved it.She liked the fact that it came with a key and she could lock it.
0123456479,4.0,Really nice box, a bit cheaply made. It is made of carboard with pleather. Although the organization for all your jewelry is great, I'm not so sure how it will stand up to my tween daughter's use. Every inch is useable space for jewelry & very compact, which is a nice feature.
0123456479,5.0,Got this as Christmas gift for my great niece & she loves it.  It is very pretty and it will hold a lot of jewelry. I'm thinking about ordering one in a different color for myself!
0123456479,5.0,Great quality for the price. I gave five stars because it was the most affordable leather jewelry box and it had enough space.However, there was sticky residue on the ear ring holders.
0123456479,5.0,I bought this for my wife for all her jewerly not sure if she would like it or not because she is very picky when it comes to stuff like this.To my happiness, she loves the jewerly box very much even though its not the standard &#34;wood&#34; box.The jewerly box is very sturdy and large to hold a million pieces of jewerly.It is very big, so we added a shelf in our bathroom where the box sits with a mirror above which is perfect for her.This box also comes with a travel box, which is very nice to hold the jewerly needed when going on vacation.Overall, I would recconmend this box if your woman would do without the traditional &#34;wood&#34; jewerly box.
0123456479,5.0,The color is very pretty! The pink is a nice change ups from the usual black or brown boxes ou typically find, it is a sofisticated pink. The box itself is extremely spacious, I personally think it is larger in person than what you see in the picture. The lock is a nice feature, but it is pretty flimsy, you can unlock it without the key very easily, but that is of no concern to me. It is a very solid box, and could stand up to traveling without a problem, you could probably throw it full force at the wall and not damage it lol. I also enjoy the mini box that comes with it. I don't normally bring jewelry with me when I travel, so I gave it to my little girl to use and she loves it.
0123456479,5.0,Love it.  Best jewelry box I ever bought.  I definitely recommend  this item, you will not be disappointed.  I 'm not.
0123456479,5.0,I received it really quick . I did not expect that box so big . Little bit heavy . Looks pretty . I like this box because there is a lot of space for ear rings but not much space for braclets . I am satisfied .
0123456479,1.0,Although the gift was loved, it was broken within two weeks!  The box was lifted up by the handle, and the cheap lock did not engage so the box opened, all the drawers fell out and the pink thin leather tore away from the cardboard frame, leaving the top and back exposed to gray cardboard.  ugh!When I shipped it back for a replacement, thinking it was likely a once in a lifetime accident, they instead refunded my money... and did not email me a single note about anything! I had to find out by checking my bank account, and even then, they only refunded $10 of the return freight when it was nearly $30 to ship back!So, when I went back to REPLACE the case, as I originally requested, they said SURE!  BUT ...  it will cost you more!  In fact, between the cost of shipping it back (exactly $28.77) and the higher cost of new re-purchase (more than $20 more), the box would have ended up costing me a total of OVER $100 FOR THIS CASE!  A CASE THAT FELL APART WHEN LIFTED BY THE HANDLE!  Fooled me once ... never again.BAD PRODUCT QUALITY.  WORSE RETURN POLICY.  RUDE EMPLOYEES. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from these people!  Amazon was no help either -- so much for their A to Z policy!  HA!  They don't vet these companies worth a dang, and then pass on the crappy vendors to customers. Boo Amazon!  And a triple boo to Shining Image!
0123456479,3.0,i bought this for sister in law for christmas. she likes it. she uses most of the stuff in it. comes with a lot of stuff
0123456479,5.0,I found the jewelry box to have a lot of space and the lay out was perfect. I plan to buy another one as a gift for a loved one.
0123456479,4.0,This was a gift for my niece.  Once I received it, I wanted one for myself. It has so many compartments and so much space. It is very cute. I'll most likely be getting one for myself in black.
0123456479,4.0,While the product title states this is a &#34;huge&#34; leather jewelry box, it is in fact not huge.  It is an OK size.  I was expecting something a bit larger.  That is my only reason for a 4, instead of 5, star rating.  The box itself came in great condition and packaged well.  It seems durable and will work out great.
0123456479,5.0,Got it for my daughter's 6th birthday, and she loves it!  It's GREAT!  Made very well, packaged very well. Just an all around great jewelry box!
0123456479,5.0,It was a hit with 8 year old grand daughter. I added a couple of dollar store jewels to be found.
0123456479,5.0,Going off to college, I got this jewelry box to store everything in. It has been so amazing! There is a ton of room; I have not been able to find any other jewelry box like this with so much room. It fits everything I wanted to bring with me, and is really easy to store. Also, very cute! I highly recommend it.
0123456479,5.0,Bought for my 4 year old granddaughter to keep for years. My wife loved it! I'm sure it will be with her for a long time. Well built and thought out.
0123456479,2.0,The inside removable box closer was stretched and so loose and not usable. When I close it, and pick it up, there're at least 1 to 1.5 inch hanging there and 2/1 inch opening where jewelry can fall out.Color is nice light baby pink though.Although the item came on time, I just was so disappointed to receive something broken after spending $50. It's not fair.
0456787283,1.0,I bought these with hopes they would not have large frames. I will be returning them as they were the average size & not small as described and they were also very cheap looking. They did arrive quicker then expected so I do not have any complaints with the seller.
0456808574,5.0,Love these.  Very sporty and great price.  The only thing is the pictures shows the top being straight across but they are a little curvy on top.  Still very cool.
0456830197,2.0,First of all, the item I received did not look as pictured. Instead of of a shiny stainless steel look, it is a matte, rough, and cheap looking metal. The button that opens the latch is the same color as the case, not the brass color in the image. Overall the case feels poorly made and it had been crushed a bit in shipping it seems since the latch takes a lot of force to properly close.Just as important as the looks, is the fact than the case is actually a bit smaller than described.I measure the exterior at 146mm X 54mm. More importantly (and I don't know why sellers don't ever provide these dimensions) the interior dimensions are even smaller, so my glasses don't fit. I measure the useable interior space at 130mm x 52mm x 27mm (at the widest point then tapers dramatically because of oval shape).
0456838384,5.0,Everybody has black wayfarers, so having a pair with gradient lenses will make you stand out. And, I think it actually looks cooler. For the price, these are fantastic.
0456840532,1.0,With all the hipsters out there, I guess I should not have been surprised that when these came, they were just clear lenses.  I ordered 250 s. They were cheap, so whatever.
0456844570,4.0,I received these sunglasses within a decent time-frame (shipped from Europe). They arrived with a quality draw string storage bag, cleaning cloth and security strap. They are well crafted, classy and attractive to wear, the only drawback is the lens aren't as &#34;purple&#34; as the picture portrays, the lens are a bit darker purple (almost black) in person but block sun rays very well. Overall I am pleased with this purchase and will be wearing these sunglasses everywhere!
0456856293,5.0,Got these on Amazon for my father. The right size and the right color lens  that he was looking for at a great price. Thanks so much!
0641674791,4.0,It is a great size for traveling and definitely chic looking. It is worth the purchase and I use it often
0641997078,5.0,I Love it and bought more for friends Came fast and as described.Will be a returning customer. Very Happy. AAA+
0681256036,4.0,It is exactly as is pictured, but I must say I like the choker from Twilight better than New Moon. New Moon's is lighter in color and much shorter.
0681358173,3.0,I bought this thinking it was thick and will keep me warm this winter, but when I got it I was pretty much upset how thin and sheer it is. I was also disappointed on the size, the seller said it was a large size, but the hood is rather tiny and  it's a little small on me! It's also made cheaply cause the fabric sheds little white fibers from the sweater jacket. I also looked on the website,[...] and saw how hig it is on the models !  Maybe it's for little petite girls to wear, I loved the hood, it has little ears.  But over all, don't waste your money on this! It costs about 35 for it!  Look elsewhere !
0681358173,4.0,I ordered two of these for my grand daughters and they are extremely cute. The girls love them but the fabric is thinner than I expected and they will sadly not stand up to real cold weather. OK for a California winter but not for skiing.
0681358173,5.0,I absolutely love this purchase. The ears are a little smaller than in the picture, other than that - I'm super happy with this item!  It's lightweight, yet warm - great for clubbing or to wear to the mall shopping etc. Great for a ski or snowboarding trip to wear around the lodge or under your winter jacket for layering. The sleeve ends are matching elastic cloth as is the bottom of the jacket so it hugs your waist, has 2 pockets, durable zipper, the pom pom ties are ADORABLE!  Just like the ad says, the sizes do run more on the small side, but zip up hoodies are pretty universal sized for the average young adult or woman. Basically one size should fit most unless your really big or really tiny.  I've looked around for a long time trying to find one of these and they do seem to be hard to come buy. I recommend this item - they tend to be seasonal, so if you wait, they will be gone!
0681358173,5.0,Cute jacket!
0742403920,3.0,Great product! This is exactly the kind of thing that would be impossible to find in stores but you can search on Amazon and find it easily!Pros:- Blank cardboard pieces that are easy to write on. (I would recommend permanent fine-tip Sharpies or colored pencils, anything else might bleed too much)- Decently thick piecesCons:- Pieces don't come apart cleanly.- All 12 in the pack are identical. (This could actually work to your advantage if you screw up on one of the pieces you could easily substitute. However all 12 being the same is a little overkill)Overall:It's a great, unique product and I'm glad Amazon made my life a lot easier so that I could find it and use it in my proposal!
0742403920,5.0,Fun to color and gift to parents on Mother's or Father's Day.  As a teacher, I've heard from moms and dads about how they loved receiving the puzzle.
0742403920,1.0,these are a neat idea but they are very very thin. I wanted to glue a photo to them and cut it out but they wouldn't work
0742403920,4.0,I bought this for my niece who loves to draw on everything! So I got her these puzzles and now she can create her own picture to put together great price for the amount you get
0742403920,1.0,Product cheaply made. Was hoping for a smoothe coating and turned out to be cheap cardboard. Ordered from Oriental Trading-------- much better product and more for same money. Would not order this again.
0742403920,5.0,These puzzles have worked great for our Chronological Bible Discipleship class. We use them as an intro for each weeks lesson on the eras of the Bible. They seem to be pretty sturdy and just the right size!
0742403920,5.0,I am going to decorate these puzzles to announce a very special Christmas surprise.  I am so glad I found them.
0742403920,5.0,Just what I was looking for.  I do a scavenger hunt at Christmas and this was part of one of the clues. Also itis perfect for my new upcoming artists in the family. May have to get more.
0742403920,5.0,The pieces are small and they are cut well, but stick together long enough to draw, paint, color. Thanks you.
0742403920,5.0,These blank puzzles are great for kids.  In the words of my child: "You get to be the artist...it's really fun to be the puzzle maker."
0742403920,5.0,I bought these puzzles to use in elementary classrooms for a lesson on getting along.  They really enjoyed making their very own puzzle.
0742403920,5.0,I got this to draw a map for a birthday gift ... it just worked perfectly ... its nice idea
0742403920,1.0,I'm disappointed this doesn't specify the number of pieces per puzzle.  From the image it appears to be 24 pieces but I would like to be sure of that before ordering.
0742403920,4.0,My 7 year old requested this for Christmas, and she had so much fun creating different puzzles for everyone in the family. Well worth the money.
0742403920,4.0,At first I was worried that it would be paper pieces, but they were actually like real puzzle pieces.Came in a pack of 12, as stated. My only complaint is that when the puzzle pieces come apart, there is a uneven spot (like when you tear a piece of cardboard) where it detaches from the other pieces.
0742403920,3.0,Some of the puzzles aren't cut all the way through which means a bit of ripping in order to separate the pieces.  It's also too bad, as someone pointed out, that all of them are the same design. Still, suited my purpose -- I used them for the kids Xmas gifts by writing gift card codes on them and breaking them up.  Gave them a little extra step to accomplish before being able to enter their iTunes codes.
0742403920,4.0,These are nice, relatively inexpensive blank puzzles that I use for centers at school. You could customize them to do anything. I really liked them. The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars is because I thought they were a little expensive.
0742403920,5.0,I thought this was a fantastic product, it came neatly packaged and all the puzzles were intact, properly cut, and undamaged. Their white surface (the side you want to write on) is the perfect surface to write on with nearly any medium. I tried permanent marker, pencil, and several different paints. I bought this item to ask a girl to prom with P R O M ? (then my name) with a character on each puzzle. I thought that was pretty crafty, I used high-quality watercolors to paint the letters and the paint stuck surprisingly well. I'm very happy with this product and if I ever need to send creative and "puzzling" messages I'll be sure to buy again. Plus it's a great price! Oh and you're probably wondering, she said yes :D
0742403920,5.0,Just as other reviewers noted, these were great: solid, well constructed, absorbed markers well, didn't tear when split into pieces.  My kids love them.
0742403920,2.0,The tee shirt transfer did not adhear to the puzzle.  I tried several times but never could get a satisfactory result
0742403920,5.0,Nice size and a nice price
0742403920,5.0,Bought this as a gift for someone very into puzzles and they loved it.  Fun way to send a kid a birthday wish or note.
0742403920,4.0,I was a bit disappointed that all of these jigsaw puzzles are the same -- meaning the pieces are interchangable between the different puzzles, but ultimately it is a good product. It was easy to draw and customize each puzzle, and they came apart pretty easily.
0756029104,3.0,It was difficult finding the right pin. In the end I chose this one because it is somewhat neutral. Teacher's Discovery should create neutral designs whereas just Spain isn't being tooted. Then again, this pin does scream Mexico, doesn't it? I'll keep looking.
0756029929,5.0,I am a Spanish teacher and I buy these especial pins to reward the best 5 students in the classroom. I have to acknowledge their success and they appreciate this more than a paper certificate. At level III.
0765599864,4.0,I bought this for a halloween costume. When it originally showed up it was bent funny and sat crooked on my face. I had to use some heavy books to reshape it. Once it was back to a better shape, it worked perfectly. It was comfortable enough that I could wear it all night too.
0839933363,5.0,The Item is built in very good quality and arrived within resonable time from the date of purchase.  I am very pleased with my order
1028907516,5.0,Thank you A++++

1340918064,5.0,I bought this as a present for one of my brothers (for starring in a steampunk play) and it came before the expected delivery date.The material is nicer-looking than in the picture. The ship has nice detail, and it comfortably fits in the palm of your hand.It was fully functioning, and my brother uses it all the time.Great price, great service.
1394751931,2.0,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.....I BUOGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY 10 YR PLD NEICE....NOT THE BEST LIKE I SAID

139475891X,3.0,It was an unusual design, that is why I bought it. It is a bit more clunky than I thought it would be, but really nice
1397458135,4.0,Bought this for a present for my husband and he seems to like it.  He wears it all the time.
1403799385,2.0,How can someone buy this item if they have absolutely no idea what size the ring is? Pleasse post some information about this.
1412718031,5.0,Ilike it very good the size is good and the color very nice ....Thank you very much for ..
1412718031,5.0,We have bought Carter sleeveless bodysuits for my son at 9 months, 12 months and again at 18 months. They are perfect for wearing under shirts. They are good quality and durable. The ones we have retired because he outgrew them still look good as new.
1412718031,5.0,These bodysuits are very well made, durable, light weight and not to mention very soft.  I purchased these just in time for the up and coming hot season and i'll be able to layer it underneath things when it gets colder without worrying about it making my baby feel too hot or adding bulk.
1412718031,3.0,The bodysuits are too big and long. Had I knew would have gotten a smaller size. Apart from this they're perfect!
1412718031,5.0,I bought this for my boy and they fitted perfectly, It is excellent for summer days and very comfortable. My son used almost every day, I would buy it again for sure.
1412718031,5.0,we wear them night and day - they are so soft and comfy. in the house they are just great! no pj's - just these to sleep in and to play in at daytime
1412718031,4.0,As with nearly any baby clothes, these run a little small. Our little girl is not even 8 mos. yet and she is almost outgrowing these (from neck to bottom, they almost don't fit without stretching a lot).I don't think that our child is a mutant giant but almost all baby clothes run small. Now she is wearing 18 mos. clothes and they fit. I fail to believe that these month fitting things are actually correct because I hear it from a lot of parents. So, if your baby is tall in any fashioned and close to 12 mos. They may not fit in these....Otherwise, we're very happy with these onesies.
1412718031,4.0,A perfect onesie for the summer, or to go under clothes in the winter. Fits well, nice soft cotton. Love the look too because it make our little guy look like a muscleman.
1412718031,5.0,These are perfect to wear under a long sleeved shirt in cooler weather. Keeps the skin covered if the shirt rides up.
1412718031,5.0,Absolutely love these undershirts for my little guy. Not a huge fan of sleeves. The sleevless make for a comfy fit under sweaters or shirts. Soft on his skin. He is 16 months and still fits in 12 months just fine but I do like the undershirts a bit snugger.
1412718031,5.0,I love them ,they fit my son well .the are good for the weather.aesy to wash .I like them because he can wear them at any season
1412718031,4.0,This is a must have for the summer. I still like to put and undershirt under my sons clothes even during the summer.
1412718031,5.0,a new baby or any age baby in a white onsie is so adorable and fresh and clean and innocent! loved those sleeveless ones especially on warm days!
1412718031,4.0,I really just needed something light and durable to go under my daughter's clothes because she has an umbilical hernia. I was expecting more durable fabric. The shirt stretches out too much for me at the collar. I usually appreciate that because my daughter has an above average sized head, but it doesn't really stretch back well. I'm glad I got them because they serve their purpose, but the quality could have been a bit better for the price.
1412718031,5.0,Very soft, very well made, as usual with Carter's. A little big, maybe for 4 mo. Would definitely buy again.
1412718031,5.0,If you purchase these from a Carter's store the price is very reasonable since they are always going on sale. They are soft and comfortable, easy to put on, and great quality overall. I use them as undershirts for my baby during the colder months. It's hard to find sleeveless onesies, but they are very useful under outfits and keep shirts from riding up.
1412719410,1.0,This has to be one of the most frustrating toys. Ours is the version with Winnie the Pooh books, but the hardware is the same. In theory it is a good idea, but it does not even come close to living up to that. Ninety percent of the time it will not recognize that there is a book inserted and will keep repeating, "Please insert a book." When it does start to read you only have to jiggle the book ever so slightly for it to ask for a book again.The "cover" of the system comes apart from the base very easily.I would not recommend this toy at all.
1412719410,1.0,It does nothing but saying "bye bye" after a long silence.Quite odd, isn't it?I returned it to amazon after trying for a few times.Awful toy.
1412719410,1.0,I just bought this for my grand daughter and it does not work.  I called the 800 number on the box they knew nothing about the toy and are sending me back to the store.  What a joke?
1412719410,1.0,I bought this fir my daughter at Sams and it just tells me to insert a book unless she has it on the last page then it sings a song or asks her questions  depending on the play mode.  My 19 month old enjoys the item I just wish I right hear the same thing over and over
1465014578,4.0,This a great size for a smaller desk. It doesn't take up the whole desk top. My daughter loves it.
1465014578,5.0,Perfect size and came with cute little light up &#34;Speak Now&#34; magnets :] This will be the perfect Christmas gift for a friend of mine who LOVES Taylor Swift and just started her new job in an office.
1564518620,5.0,It says right in the description that these are 8.5x11" but I guess I didn't catch that part.  These cards are nice and big, sturdy and thick.  I bought Pentomino cards for my young daughters to "play" with (we homeschool and I like to use logic and spatial reasoning puzzles as fun afternoon activities.)  These are neat but aren't something they reach for unless I encourage them to do so.  My husband, on the other hand, likes them and finds some of the advanced level puzzles quite challenging. :)
1564518620,2.0,I really wanted the shapes and the pattern cards.  The description is vague and the picture depicts both the shapes and pattern cards.  I tried to make the best of a bad situation by trying to find the corresponding shapes and have not been able to do so on Amazon, multiple school supply company sites and even on the Ideal Company site itself.  The cards are utterly useless without the shapes.
1564518620,5.0,We have recently become fans of pentominos at our house (the 12 year old and parents) after reading Chasing Vermeer by Blue Balliett (fabulous book).  These pattern cards are a great addition to a pentomino set.  We use them for fun and in homeschool (would be great for classroom use also)
1564518620,2.0,I incorrectly assumed that the Pentomino Tiles would come with this product but they do not therefore this product was essentially useless for us.
1564518620,5.0,I got these for my niece and nephew who are pre-teens.  I got them in conjunction with a set of pentominoes, which was one of my favorite games to play with when I was a kid.  I still play with them.
1564518620,5.0,The cards go perfectly with the pentomino shapes. I would have appriciated it,if you could wipe them... But other than that, they are an exciting toy (just together with the pentominoes).
1564518620,5.0,I bought these cards for one of my classroom math centers.  My students love them!  Great purchase and well worth the price.
1593153767,5.0,The bag is cute, and has just enough room for all of my crap. Its a little small but it makes it much easier to find everything! I recommend it for all yaoi fans! I promise you will enjoy carrying it around.
1595067566,5.0,Love these earrings.  I didn't expect them to be this nice because of the price.  I am pleased, though.  I get compliments from people on these earrings.  Would recommend.
1608299562,1.0,Starts with matching exercises with no explanations of what the words mean. I found this product expensive. It did me no good.
1608299562,1.0,Never really tried to use the online version but after receiving a trial CD of how to speak Dutch I decided to give the online one a try for Arabic.  I should of stuck to what I knew.  The online version is a joke if it's anything like this level one version here.(which I image it is the exact same product  It's just pictures and done way too formal.  Rosetta Stone has had success with some languages but Arabic is a total waste of time and money.  My friends I told laughed at me for how I was pronouncing words and phrases.  If you want a more authentic feel to it try Rocket Arabic's course for a fraction of the price.  I have listened to a few of their lessons and their structure and explanation make waaaaay more sense than what Rosetta Stone tried to do.  I am now in an email battle with hope trying to get my money back for the online course I tried.  Should be no contest being that they "stand behind their product with a money back guarantee", figure they'd do the same with all their products.Again, don't bother with this.  Arabic is not a language you can dumb down and learn looking a pictures and have no clue what you are doing.
1608299562,1.0,Okay, I do actually own this product, and I have also been a student of Arabic for some years now. I really would not recommend Rosetta Stone products for non-European languages for several reasons, but I focus on the Arabic here (and I assume the learner is a native English speaker):-The type of Arabic this teaches you is called Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Fusha. This is the "higher register" of Arabic which is used in formal settings by the educated class: the news, academics, some clerics, most literature. Generally, Arabic speakers use a local dialect of Arabic, which is very, very different from this version of the language. For instance: imagine reading a work of Medieval "Middle" English. The language would be mostly quasi-familiar English words, but most of the usage, pronunciation, and grammar would seem tricky, overly complex, or old-fashioned. You would be able to understand some of it, but would miss a bit, too. "The sky is blue" would be like "de heofon ist hewn bleu." MSA is like that to 90% of Arabic speakers: not totally gibberish, but not approachable either. Don't misunderstand me though, all Arabic learners should learn MSA, but know that you won't be speaking it much.-The reverse is also a problem. You can speak all the MSA you want (from Rosetta Stone or elsewhere) but almost no one will speak it back to you, and some people will literally laugh in your face for speaking that way. None of the living dialects of Arabic are that close to MSA, so even if you memorized every word of Rosetta Stone Arabic, you would not be able to understand almost anyone who didn't go to university.-To make matters even weirder, Rosetta Stone Arabic included the highly complicated case endings (called Iraab) on all the words. That is to say, there are certain changes to the last vowels of most words in the most formal of formal Arabic literature, like the Qur'an, the Bible, and poetry. These case endings mark what part of speech is being used, so for example "kitaab" is "book," "kitaabun" is "book" if it is the subject of the sentence, "kitaabi" is "book" if it is direct object, "kitaaba" is "book" if it is in a prepositional phrase, etc. It is very complex and NO ONE EVER, EVER SPEAKS THAT WAY, even in MSA. Iraab use is technically correct, but even native speakers get confused by it (and rightly so). Not only does it not reflect any normal Arabic speech, because Rosetta Stone does not explain any grammar directly, I seriously doubt anyone would be able to sort out the meanings of the case endings just from context. This one was a major blunder that is mind-boggling for such an expensive product.-More on the grammar bit: it is great that Rosetta Stone wants to avoid speaking English, but Arabic grammar is not intuitive for English speakers. Therefore, unless you already have a fair bit of Arabic grammar, you will be completely confused. For example, in Arabic there is a system of root letters that make up most words. The pattern of these roots changes depending on meaning, so if a book is "green" it is "akhdar," but if a car is "green" it is "khadr'." Unless you already know that Arabic has a masculine/feminine gender system, and a root for greeness based on the letters kh-d-r, you would not be able to deduce what was happening (I really, really doubt it anyway.) Arabic has lots of grammar that throws English speakers for a loop and needs to be explained directly and in detail: there are tons of ways to pluralize, a "dual" case between singular and plural, a very different sentence structure, and on and on.-There is no cultural context provided, which is really strange. Why would I need to know the word for "sandwich" in the formal register of Arabic? Why does it teach how to say someone is "Russian" or "Japanese" and not how to say they are "Jordanian," "Saudi Arabian," or "Moroccan"?I could only imagine two reasons someone would find Rosetta Stone Arabic useful:1. If they already spoke some Arabic and wanted a refresher course in the more formal parts of the language, which I guess could happen.2. They wanted to focus specifically on Arabic literature of some sort and already had some familiarity with Arabic grammar and syntax.Do not buy this product if:1. You want to learn Arabic from scratch on your own. You will learn nothing at all, I swear.2. You are traveling to the Arab world and want some basic speaking skills.3. You want to learn about Arab culture or the language's use and history.I didn't intend to rant but this is a very expensive product and it really is not worth the cd its copied on. If you want to learn MSA or one of the many dialects (or better yet, both), get a dictionary, a class, and a plane ticket.
1608299562,5.0,You can't beat Amazon.com and Rosetta Stone with outstanding access to language courses that fits individual needs! I love my new study of the Arabic language through listening and viewing total absorption into the language. I already know the alphabet of 28 "letters" and I can read it well to a beginner's point. It's cool being able to immediately read and sound out Arabic words on restaurants with Arabic titles here in Texas. I will be taking the 2nd and 3rd level Arabic by Rosetta Stone. It's the FASTEST way to learn a language. I have gone through Amazon Books for Russian and Latin offered by Rosetta Stone.
1608299562,3.0,So much has been said and advertised about this product that giving it less than 5 stars might raise a few eyebrows. I'll preface this by saying that I was a public school teacher for many years, grew up with languages and spend every day, now, working with Iraqi refugees.  This might sound like the perfect situation to purchase Arabic by Rosetta Stone? Not so.  First of all, the headset/microphone was of poor quality and only picks up my words now and then. It's difficult to score well when the program thinks you are not speaking. Secondly, one should understand that there is not one word of English with this product nor did I receive any instructions on how to use it. It became trial and error. Thirdly, I was unaware that the dialects in Arabic are so numerous that Rosetta stone was not terribly useful when speaking with Iraqis.  This is, by no means, the fault of Rosetta Stone but I wish I knew this before my purchase. Lastly, so many of the lessons used phrases that were of no use to me in the real world in which I work. Again, Rosetta Stone would not have any idea which phrases to teach and which phrases to use but I have, yet, no need to be able to talk about a group of men who might be running or a woman eating an apple. Yes, I am being facetious but not terribly so.Bottom line: do a bit of homework before making this, somewhat, costly investment. It is not instant access to a foreign language as the ads would have you believe.
1608299562,3.0,I did my first view courses, and was totally confused. It shows pictures and words in Arabic and has me pronounce them, but never tells me what I am actually saying. For example, there is a picture of a man trying to catch a bus. When I pronounce the Arabic above it, what am I saying? "The man is late?" "The man is running?" "The man is about to get hit by a bus?" I just don't know! Can anyone help?
1608299562,4.0,If you are looking to learn Arabic for a course you are taking in college, or high school this is great. This software teaches you the main stream Arabic, which is used in books, news etc, but not movies. Most people different dialects but if you know the main Arabic then everyone should be able to understand you, the only problem is that they may not reply in it.I as an Egyptian, and a native speaker of Arabic believe this is a good approach to learning Arabic, because i h ave used it for my son.But of course there are those who will hate this software, and for that reason I believe that you should download a trial, and see how you like this
1608299562,1.0,Thinking I would help get a head start on an Arabic course I was taking over the summer I purchased Rosetta Stone Arabic Level 1 back in the spring.  I feel like I've been cheated.  I paid almost $200 for a virtually worthless program.  If you cannot read the Arabic alphabet you are pretty much screwed.  Lesson one starts with an Arabic phrase popping up on the screen, which you repeat.  Regardless of how you pronounce it it gives you the green light then continues.  It repeats a phrase, then you select one of the four pictures below.  You figure it out after failing for a while that they are saying boy, girl, man, woman, etc...  Bash your head against the keyboard for a bit longer, then you go on to another lesson.  You are given no grammar, no explanation of what you are saying or doing.  It's immersion alright, but with no practical application.  Did I mention it's MSA(Modern Standard Arabic)?  If you do figure out what you are supposed to be learning, try whipping out some awesome MSA to a native speaker of Arabic and watch them try to smile and find a polite way to let you know you sound like an idiot.  I will never buy Rosetta Stone products ever again.
1608299627,2.0,After learning Spanish the &#34;old fasioned way&#34;, I find Rosetta Stone to be useless. The pictures are often unclear, and it keeps showing the same one every time, meaning that you can just associate the pattern of letters with the picture without understanding anything.
1608299627,1.0,After I brought this program, I did not use it until two years later, to my horror it said the program needs to be renew, it expired! I need to buy another new program. I call customer support, and they want me to buy another same program. I would never buy rossetta stone again.
1608299627,4.0,Many people complain about no English translations on the screen when you hear new words and phrases.It's important to realize that when using Rosetta Stone, you are not supposed to completely understand the words/phrases when you hear them the first time, or even the second or third.  You're not supposed to know the answers before the software asks you to interact.  Rosetta Stone forces your mind to grasp at possible meanings until you puzzle it out, and when you do finally puzzle it out, a light bulb flashes on and true comprehension takes place.Rosetta Stone integrates failure and 'learning by trial and error' directly into the program which, for me, makes the vocabulary and usage far more concrete in my head than being told what something means then picking it out of a list.  What good does that do?If you pay attention to the pictures and the context in which they are displayed, you really can intuit the meanings of the words and phrases.  After you fail to choose the correct answers then finally get it right, this stuff will be burned into your memory because you've been actively engaged in the 'discovery of the language.  Exactly like a kid does.  Exactly what Rosetta Stone claims.To summarize: you can't sit there and passively learn the language.  Rosetta Stone won't download it into your brain.  You have to actively interpret what you're seeing with what's being said in the new language.  It's amazing how much language and nuance can be assimilated in this way.
1608299627,3.0,This is ok but I really just wanted to brush up on the Mandarin I took in college.  I don't want something that I have to schedule sessions during the day for since I have to work on a full-time basis.  Isn't there a software program for working professionals to use?  If I wanted to schedule sessions during the day, I would have signed up for a class at my local university and paid 3 times more.
1608299627,1.0,I have just received the package but I can not try it yet because ROSETTA STONE ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO REGISTER THE SOFTWARE ON 1 COMPUTER!!!  I now have to haul my work laptop home everyday just to try this program so that I can also use it in work environments.  I know they have to protect their software, BUT COME ON, at least let your users register it on at least 2 computers!This is not starting out well.  I hope things go better from here or I might have to take them up on their money back guarantee.
1608299627,5.0,I love the format of the course. I come back to it every night. Unlike video games, you'll come away with a skill for all your effort. Unlocking power boxes and shooting virtual punks is a waste of time. I know one Chinese woman that I can try this out on, I hope she's not Cantonese. There's always restaurants. Xie xie.
1608299627,5.0,Rosetta Stone teaches languages the same way a child learns a native language, through images and immersion. I learned the basics so fast and I'm able to use Chinese in my everyday language with a few friends who speak it as I learn and develop more.Rosetta Stone also provides great online support opportunities like games, one-on-one conversations with native speakers, and additional reading materials.I recommend Rosetta Stone to anyone who wants to learn to speak a new language but finds traditional classrooms intimidating and has trouble remembering translations.
1608299627,1.0,I received Chinese 1-3 as a gift and it promised to have online lessons and games. These never activated and thus I was never able to use this product as advertised. I contacted customer support several times and more or less they told me "tuff s***". I have since become fluent in Chinese by taking lessons with a local for $10/h. Take my advice, get a Chinese tutor, or take classes. Tutoring and classes from native speakers didn't even cost me as much as this product would have. Furthermore, take the advice of many polyglots like myself and get a different program. This is way over-priced for what it provides. Actually, it may even hurt your progress in learning Chinese. Don't waste your time and money with this!
1608299627,5.0,Great way to learn Mandarin.  The lessons are clear and easy to understand and make it fun and very interesting.
1608299627,5.0,I am very glad I made this purchase. It was a little expensive; however, he loves it (so, obviously, it was worth it). It came with two downloads so I can learn too!
1608299627,2.0,My company purchased this for the employees and after using this for four months and over 50 hours, I am very disappointed with this.First issue and the main issue is that ALL the words have NO English word affiliation on the screen. Rosetta expects you to understand the picture, the hardest are the action pictures, for instance a man is giving a woman red flowers, a word is displayed, what does this mean, "Giving", "Receiving", "Flowers" or "Red", you just don't know until later when you go through the process of elimination. This is very frustrating, thinking one way and then being corrected later.The speech recognition is very good and the only reason I gave this program 2 stars.If you are want to learn Chinese, AVOID this program! I have used several and the one I stayed with is the "Transparent Language" programs. You can see what I mean for free at the [...] site. You may like something different, but DON'T BUY INTO THE AD CAMPAIGN ON THIS!I hope this helps you.Michael
1608299627,4.0,It was quick to arrive. My son has not yet tried to &#34;learn&#34; the language. Will have to see what happens.
1608299627,2.0,Purchased as a gift, but was told that CD wasn't loadable to the PC and had to go through online download.  Also, the learning method is non-traditional and difficult for learner to follow.
1608299627,4.0,I like it but when I started the program, I was given a choice of Pingyin (I think that's how it's spelled) and traditional.  I chose Pingyin, but now I want to switch to traditional and I can't go back and switch.  I hope that once I complete the Pingyin program, I will be able to do the traditional program.
1608299627,5.0,I have purchased the Mandarin Level 1 to evaluate Rosetta Stone, and although I find the system excellent, I was shocked to see that i cannot use the Totale Companion feature on my iPad and iPhone without a monthly charge after a three month trial. As I travel a great deal, one of the reasons I went for Rosetta Stone was to have many of its features as well on a mobile device. At $179 for the software for you to charge a monthly fee for the app is wholly unjustified. As a result I shall not purchase advanced lessons from Rosetta  Stone. Instead I shall search for a competitive product that offers a mobile app with unlimited use and that I, and other disatisfied users, will eventually find. Competition will out you and In the end you will be the losers.
1608299627,1.0,It was not clear it was not useable in the car.  It has never worked in the computer.  Help line not available
1608299627,5.0,The old Rosetta Stone I had been using for Mandarin was excellent, so I bought Totale mostly out of curiosity.  It is everything a language software could and should be.  Truly a total program.  It keeps track of your progress for you and instead of separating out reading and writing modules, they are seamlessly integrated into the lessons.  The USB microphone works better than any of my old microphones, even gaming microphones.  It is sensitive, so you can speak softly and still have your pronunciation evaluated perfectly well, thus sparing your family some annoyance.  There are online interactions scheduled at times even the very busiest people can connect with.Don't even try other programs.  I have a bookshelf full of them.  TOTALe is great, and although I never did think the old versions of RS would have worked for everyone, this one definitely will.
1608299627,2.0,The program itself is great.  The immersion works well, and it is entertaining to puzzle through new words via their scenarios.  Voice recognition is top notch as well.  It's a great learning tool.Unfortunately....  it is saddled with the most onerous copy protection I have yet encountered.  It is so dreadful that it drops my rec straight from 5 star to 2 star.Basically you can only install it twice.  Hard drive dies?  That counts as one.  Upgrade your OS?  Counts as one.  There is a "de-activate" function which supposedly returns one of the licenses, but you can only do that if you remember beforehand, or there is not a technical difficulty that prevents it.  The one time I was in a position to try the "de-activate" feature it did not return the license.After you run out of your two installs you then have to call their technical support for each and every install after.  If you are a tech type who upgrades systems and OSes frequently this literally results in HOURS of extra overhead spent on the line with indian tech support to get your licenses reinstated.  Hope you kept your proof of purchase all that time as well, without it you now have a $200 yellow coaster.
1608299627,2.0,I enthusiastically tried to use this product when learning Chinese in China while working as an English teacher.  Day after day I sat down with this product, and went through the level one modules.  The problem with learning language becomes immediately apparent when you realize you can say things like "these are two boys" or "the table has five plates" but cannot say tho most basic survival phrases such as "Hello my name is_______".  Also I encountered a phenomenon where I could remember the words when using Rosetta stone, but not in real life on the streets and in the classroom.  I thought I was a terrible language learner.Language acquisition research has shown motivation to be one of the highest factors of success in learning a language.  Rosetta stone is extremely demotivating.  It does not teach practical language.  If they included basic survival conversations from the very beginning, this would be a much better product, however the developers have chosen instead to recreate an experience of using an extremely large and onerous set of flashcards.I had used Rosetta stone for four months.  I saw very little progress in my ability to actually use the language.  Then in Shanghai I bought a simple textbook for about $5 that used dialogues with an audio CD included.  I studied this for a week and my Chinese ability skyrocketed.  This was because I was learning the simple survival language that humans use everyday and I desperately needed.Don't believe the marketing hype.  A child learns their first language over a period of about 7 years.  A baby can learn a bunch of random vocabulary words and simple grammatical structures without needing to say things like where is the bathroom?  The child just has to cry and someone figures out what is wrong.  Most adults would like to avoid sitting in a restaurant and crying until someone figures out they need to use the bathroom.  It is extremely demotivating to know how to say "He takes the red flowers" but not be able to say "I want a glass of water please".  Buy a $20 textbook with an audio CD.  Go through the lessons and listen to the conversations on the audio CD.  Use the rest of your money to pay a tutor to speak chinese with you.  You will learn Chinese and any other language much faster this way.
1608299740,1.0,You better have someone on hand that knows how to use the program because there are no instructions for user trying to learn the language. Chinese was chosen as the interface language and it only lasted one screen then everything was in english. If you don't know english don't try to learn it with this.
1608299740,4.0,The course is quite useful but it is inconvenient to have a langualge course to learn English where the set up begins in English.
1608299740,5.0,My wife teaches ESL (English as a second language). She is using the basic program. It is working  very well. Her students love it.
1608299740,5.0,The best language course to have when learning a foreign language. Easy to learn with audio/visual DVD course. Great buy!
1608299740,5.0,It is exactly as ordered, prompt delevery, what else do you want: perfect. Price is right, would order it again if I needed another one.
1608299740,5.0,I purchase this product recently to enforce my English and is really helping me with me.I encourage any one who need he'll with the language to get this product plus the price was great.
1608299899,1.0,There are many different ideas on the best way for adults to learn a foreign language. Much depends on the student, their goals, and their self-discipline. Dealing with a tonal language or a language with a different script, the student need make some big decisions about how they want to learn, and how much. Relatively speaking, Filipino/Pilipino/Tagalog is easy.I learned Spanish as an adult. I am now fluent at a professional/business level. About 10-15% of Tagalog is Spanish, and the spelling of Tagalog words are all based on Spanish sounds.I learned to read Thai. I can write some, but my vocabulary is very small. 90% of my Thai came from taking private one-on-one classes while living in Thailand for 6 months.I studied some Tagalog, some Korean, and some Thai using Rosetta Stone.If you just want to learn some Tagalog to get around as a tourist, enough people speak excellent English in the Philippines you will probably never be able to use it. The Filipinos who don't speak English will typically avoid speaking to you, even when you try to speak Tagalog. Regardless, an immersion product, like Rosetta Stone, is probably not as useful because much of the vocabulary and context is not related to what you will want to know (do you really need to say the boy is under the soccer ball?).If you want to seriously learn the language to be able to carry on casual or business conversations, commit early and realize there is far more work involved. To really practice Tagalog, you will need to go to less savory parts of Manila, or plan on getting outside of Manila, Cebu, away from the red light districts in Olongapo and Angeles, and avoid the resort areas like Puerta Galera and Boracay. To really use Tagalog, you need to go to areas where those who don't speak English are willing to make an effort to understand you.For me, I first needed to learn the alphabet. Since spelling is based on Spanish phonetics and the Roman alphabet, this was easy for me with Tagalog. For other languages, like Thai, you CANNOT consistently pronounce Thai correctly using Romanized phonetics. T one rules are only consistent in Thai script.  Among other challenges, the Romanization is wildly inconsistent. You learn it one way, and then another source using different phonetics mires you in confusion. The same is probably also true of Korean, as it is also a phonetic language. Learning Chinese will likely be different. This part of Tagalog is easy though.Second, I realized for me, I need to take notes. As adults we want to take notes to help remember key points. If you take the notes in English, you are handicapping yourself. This is more difficult, and far more important, in languages with their own script.Third, again for me, I knew learning translation would create a permanent handicap. Early on, translation is easier, later on translation must be unlearned as it stilts actual conversation and thinking. You just can't translate fast enough. Even now, being fluent in Spanish, translating gives me a headache and frustrates me. I either have a conversation in Spanish, thinking in Spanish, or I have a conversation in English thinking in English. If I know a word in one language and not the other, my whole train of thought is derailed. Avoiding learning translation is where Rosetta Stone shines.I like the idea of Rosetta Stone. If you are disciplined and do the lessons, you will expand your spoken vocabulary rapidly. You will remember what you learn. For reading and writing, Rosetta Stone is limited. I doubt it will do much for reading and writing with non-Roman scripts. Like any learning tool, disciplined study will yield results.Rosetta Stone is very expensive. Competing products like L-Lingo or products using different methods like Pimsleur, TellMeMore.com, Assimil, or Fluenz (supposedly the best, but only in a few languages) are a fraction of the cost of Rosetta Stone. Many of the different methods will work better for some people than others. Assimil is translation based. Pimsleur is hard to describe, but has a very good fluency success rate (supposedly). Look up Fluenz also, as the method and reviews suggest it is very effective in the few languages they offer.Besides cost, what is the other drawback to Rosetta Stone?The drawbacks are legion.Version 2 is good. Version 2 is how Rosetta Stone grew into a powerhouse. The voice recognition is very primitive. Version 3 is a refinement of version 2 with improved continuity, a smoother interface, better quizzes, and the ability to get rid of the stupid "must have CD with you at all times" limitation. You can also advance or return to the exact spot where you left off earlier.Unfortunately, Rosetta Stone dropped support for Version 2. Even though they were selling version 2 from their own website in 2012, they dropped support. Mac users are especially impacted as Mac OSX Lion will no longer run PPC apps, and Rosetta Stone never ported Version 2 to Intel. So, if you bought Version 2 in 2012 to use on a Mac, you were ripped off by Rosetta Stone. Join the crowd.Windows users should not be too smug about the situation, as the end of Version 2 support means your product will have all sorts of issues too, unless you downgrade to WinXP.Version 3 does run on current platforms, and is at least somewhat supported (to the extent Rosetta Stone supports any product). Version 3 is easily the pinnacle of Rosetta Stone software. Given so many users prefer version 3 to version 4 though, don't be surprised if they pull a Microsoft and force you to their new product nobody wants.Total 4e, is a retrograde of Rosetta Stone. To be fair, if you are always connected -- literally 100% of the time, never a lost packet -- and live your life via social media, Total 4e might be effective. Don't expect to use the highly touted iOS apps on your iPhone or iPad though unless you are connected 100% of the time with those devices also. The whole idea of quickly practicing while in line or waiting in an office...yeah, that doesn't conform to the Rosetta Stone licensing model.Speaking of which, Rosetta Stone now has two components and two licensing models. There is the software application and the online social media part. The application can be run as long as they support it on current platforms. The online social media component is now on a subscription basis. You pay for every month in which you want to participate. You can still use the app on your computer, but you just paid a premium for online access you aren't using unless you continue to pay the subscription.Given there are many free or lower cost websites where learners can interact and practice language skills, why pay Rosetta Stone a monthly premium for less content? Therein lies the reason so many people look at Total 4e and then try to find version 3 before supplies run out.How about another suggestion?Try L-Lingo. L-Lingo uses a very similar learning model to Rosetta Stone. The interface actually has more features than Rosetta Stone and you can customize the interface to use Roman phonetics or native script. They have iPad and iPhone/IPod Touch iOS apps which you can use on a plane, or anywhere else, with or without Internet access. Best of all, all of their programs together (Win or Mac desktop, iPad, iPhone/iPod Touch) are less than half the cost of Rosetta Stone Level I.L-Lingo specializes in Asian languages. They are probably a superior option to Rosetta Stone Total 4e for most users. L-Lingo offers a free trial for their desktop application, and also for their iOS applicastions for some languages.There are other good options listed above, particularly Fluenz and Pimsleur which use different methods. Be sure to check them out before buying anything published by Rosetta Stone.
1608299899,5.0,I've never used a Rosetta product before, but I have used similar products with great disappointment. Fortunately, I was thrilled with the product. It was fun like they had advertised. Most language-learning products are hard to use and a real chore. I was very surprised.
1608299899,4.0,I bought this about a week ago and I've lesson two of unit one (there are about 10 sections to each lesson).  With only limited time to practice in the evenings I'm learning fast and can now say several words and simple sentences.  I'm nowhere near fluent, but it's a start and if I keep making progress at this speed, I may be fluent in no time!PROS: Easy to use, has short lessons (from 5 min to 30 min) if you're pressed for time and you can work at your own pace, love the voice recognition software so I know I'm saying things right, fun games and stories to increase vocabulary and reinforce what you've learned.  Has many different sections for different areas of language study - vocabulary, reading and writing, listening and speaking, pronunciation and grammar.  You can go back and repeat lessons or even just certain sections of the lessons if you didn't get a high score the first time. Also once you finish the final review or a lesson, it sets a date for you to go back and do the review again to reinforce everything so you don't lose those basics.CONS: You can only activate it on ONE computer (no putting it on your home computer and laptop - for your smart phone, however, there's an app for that!), nothing is explained or translated (not really a problem with vocabulary, but it would be nice to have the option of explaining the grammar a bit more - still pretty easy to pick up). The advertised chats with native speakers are only available during certain times (for instance for me it's 4pm-8pm PST) and you have to schedule a session.Granted I've not been using it long, but I'm already looking forward to buying phase 2 and 3 to complete my Tagalog learning. ^.^
1608299899,4.0,This was a gift for my daughter in law and two grandchildren who want to learn the Pilipino language. According to them it is a good product. I heard my granddaughter say a few words in the  Philippine national language. They will come for a visit in a few months and I am expecting to hear a few more words from my family members in the States with the help of the Rosetta stone
1608299899,5.0,Learning the way you did as child.. Total surround in language,, simple exercises, frustrating when you get it wrong, but that is not the soft wares fault.
1608299899,1.0,I did level 1 of Filipino and I thought it was basically worthless.Maybe you have to complete all levels to be able to use something but level 1 will teach you nothing usuable.What's amazing to me is how much money Rosetta Stone charges people for this software.Buy Berlitz products. They are a lot cheaper and more useful.
1608299953,4.0,I've tried other ways to learn a new language and Rosetta is still the cream of the crop. The learning process is very intuitive and away with a good, if basic, understanding of French vocabulary.  At this level you won't be speaking French fluently but you'll get a basic understanding of the language before heading on to the level 2.
1608299953,5.0,Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself, I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone software 1 level at a time, like this French level 1. That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.
1608299953,1.0,I bought this software to learn mandarin and installed it on my desk top, and now it would not allow me to install it on my laptop. This software is for only one-time use.  It does not say anywhere on the box or the directions that you can install it only on one computer. I paid full price for this. The online support told me that if I want it on my lap top I must pay full price for another copy. Very disappointing. Most software allow three installs in case the computers crash happens or what not. I find this to be ridiculous. I do not recommend it. If you want to learn Chinese, there are many online tutors cheaper and live then to pay for another copy of this software.
1608299953,5.0,I can't wait to use this-my 9 year old has a fantastic ear for language and I'd like to do this together...I love the voice recognition technology!!  It comes with CDs that you can take with you or download to your mp3 player.  Along with the software there is a headset that has voice recognition. I am not tech savvy at all..(thank God my husband is) but this doesn't appear over my head at all.But it looks like there as so many ways to learn on this...can't wait to try this out.
1608299953,4.0,I was VERY excited to get this product as I had heard awesome things about it. Full disclosure, I've tried multiple times to learn Spanish and have failed every time. I was hoping this product would be able to overcome my genetic inability to speak anything other than English. After installing the product, I started down the path to learn French. I figured maybe I needed to try a different language, which is why I selected the French version. The software itself was easy to install and offers a free 3 month online version for my smartphone. I tried multiple times, I really tried but my genetics overcame my willpower to speak a different language.For those that haven't seen the software in use, you are presented with pictures of men, women, children, etc performing different activities. You learn how to say women vs woman, men vs man, etc. The software builds on what you have learned, adding another level of complexity, which I am sure works for a lot of people, but not for me. My expectations were high and I didn't have any issues with the software, my brain on the other hand just refused to adapt. I honestly couldn't blame Rosetta stone for my lack of retention or ability to make my words sound like their words.That being said, I think full immersion in the culture along with this course would be optimal way to use this software.Even after my failure, I would still recommend this program to another person.
1608299953,4.0,Being that I have a french heritage but don't live there I decided it was about time that I learned a little more of the language so that I can actually speak to certain family members more easily vs them having to muddle through trying to speak english and me not understanding what they are trying to say... LOL.So I got this and installed it and tried it out. One key thing that you need to remember is that unless you actually sit there and speak the words then it's not going to do you nearly as much good as it could. Participate in it fully and you'll get much farther than you think you would.Now there are a lot of different language learning softwares on the market but rosetta stone seems to be a very well respected one and from what I've experienced they kind of deserve the respect. Would I like it somethings were different...? Of course, I would like the world to bend to my will... LOL. But none the less it's a great bit of software, well more like a lot of software.Some Pros:Unlike a lot of generic software RS makes it a point to associate words with concepts and ideas while other programs just give you a translation, this helps with the learning process greatly.Vocabulary, without a big vocabulary it's going to be hard to understand what's being said and how to respond. RS teaches you a large variety or words to help with understanding.Cons:I really disliked the lack of language structure given in terms of grammatical uses of the words for spoken language, as in how to speak properly. In this beginners level it seems to concentrate mainly on just teaching you the words instead of giving you a combination of words and how to implement them properly. Granted this is Level 1 but it would have been much nicer if there was a lot more sentence structure given versus just the vocabulary and small hints at structure.All in all it's helpful as I can now make out what my relatives are now saying when I speak to them on skype or other means, which is great but I still have a lot to learn to really speak the language.My other issue with the software is the price.... I find it pretty over priced for what you get in just one level of the software. I haven't tried a whole lot of the other systems out there but I do know a few who have and those who have have all commented that this software is overpriced for what you get compared to other systems out there. Overall, I don't know that I would spend the asking price on this software for what you get with it...Good luck to those that are trying to expand their horizons and learn more languages, I wish you all success.
1608299953,1.0,The theory that people can learn a language as adults in the same way that we learned it as a child is laughable. Children do not have the perceptions, presuppositions and logic centers that an adult has and will use to try and figure out what it meant by the pictures.All RS does is show you pictures and say something, you have to guess what is being talked about. Is it the boy? The Table? The grass? Something about the Boy? His hair? Something about his hair? You have no idea what the audio is talking about. You eventually figure out which picture is meant, but you have no idea why in most cases.From there, the difficulty and length of sentences increases exponentially till you are listening to paragraphs about your choices. Epic Fail as they say. Let us also keep in mind that it takes a child nearly two years to begin to speak....like a two year old. Does this sound like a good investment of your time?If the program worked as well as they say it does, they would not have to spend so much on marketing in places like Sky Mall. Pimsleur doesn't act this way, why? Because they have the best approach of any language course out there. If you want to actually be able to speak the language you are learning, get Pimsleur.
1608299953,4.0,The product itself is five stars, however the description is faulty.  I researched this product a great deal before purchasing and even got the free demo CD first.  I really do like the learning process, it feels intuitive.  The problem is, sitting at my desktop computer is inconvenient and I do not have a laptop.  So when I learned that there is an "App for that", I was thrilled.  I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.  For three months I made great progress whether at home, in the backyard or at work on my lunch hour.  On day 91 I suddenly could not connect, my apps kept saying "no course found for this account".  The product still works on my desktop but it turns out the apps portion of the product was just a free trial.  If I want to continue learning this way I need to purchase a very expensive subscription.  No where on this product page does it say that the companion apps are a trial version.  I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon.  I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former.  Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!  My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, "Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone. Three month access included with purchase."  I personally think it is still obscure since the part about the mobile companion is much farther down in the description but at least it is something.
1608299953,4.0,The first question was which computers to install this program - Rosetta Stone has a two seat minimum. I ended up putting the 2nd installation on a laptop, expecting to use the program in other locations.  However, Rosetta Stone's immersion method feels too intensive to me for use in most places away from home.  Installation was easy enough even though the program got stuck a couple of times along the way. The gear, headset with microphone, is sufficient.Pros:* For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people, this seemed very good.* The voice recognition software is impressive. I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly. There are plenty of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn't a problem for me yet it's something to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules. I feel the need for this and can source it out separately, but again I prefer to learn outside a formal classroom.* Lack of simple visuals to help with identifying grammatical patterns.
1608299953,4.0,I thought I'd give this a try during the summer before I started my university French class. I've taken Spanish before, but that was almost 10 years ago, and the only other language (besides English) I became proficient at was Hmong, which I learned through a religious text in Hmong and in English, some flash cards and a dictionary that was Hmong to English, in addition to spending time around native speakers daily.I don't believe there is a perfect way to learn a language, and our minds are far different than they were when we were children. Rosetta Stone does seem to be effective, though. I remember almost everything I've learned, and the grammar starts to identify itself as you work through it. I wouldn't go in with the mindset that everything is exactly as it seems; French, like Spanish, has verb tenses, and they all sound similar (moreso than Spanish), but if you watch for them, they become clear. Rosetta Stone makes you work a bit harder for the grammar, but the vocabulary comes pretty easily. I don't believe language learning is easy; it's hard to learn how to say the words, how to use them, and for me, hard to hear them coming from the mouths of natives. Rosetta Stone does a good job because it uses native speakers of both genders to say the words. I think it has its flaws, like how finicky the audio recognition can be, and I find the lessons can get boring because they get a bit repetitive, but I think that is a personal thing.Also, I think it's a great tool for people trying to learn a language who don't have much educational background. Sometimes I would work with old Hmong women, and while they struggled with using the English Rosetta Stone, they would have struggled far more sitting in a class with me trying to teach them through translation, since most of them couldn't read Hmong anyway.I see it as a useful tool, and a unique one amongst the more normal solutions. I still recommend some reading and writing and grammar study, but a lot of that manifests itself in Rosetta Stone if you aren't too lazy about it. Good product. I like it.
1608299953,5.0,So far this has been great fun for me and my kids.  The learning system is very immersive and might seem daunting at first, but they do such a great job of breaking into down into very simple pieces that if you just "go with it" you'll find it really works.  My kids are picking up far faster than I am, but that's to be expected.  They're young, they hear several languages a day at school, and it's much more natural for them.  That said I'm picking up a little French and I'm just trying to have fun with it.  One of my kids is far more focused on it and he's picking up a lot more than I am.I think as long as you are willing to put in the time this really works.  A casual user like me isn't going to get more than a few phrases, but a serious person can and will learn.  I like that it is reasonably kid friendly, though younger kids will need an adult to help things along.  Overall a great product, and while expensive, you are getting your money's worth (considering what a class would cost).
1608299953,5.0,Okay, I admit it. I'm one of the millions of Americans that massively struggles with any language either than English. I have recently returned to college to finish out my Bachelors. The university I'm enrolled in requires two years of a foreign language. Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now. BUT with using Rosetta, I was not only able to get through my class without sounding and feeling like an idiot, but I actually got A's!! I never thought that was a possibility. I'm not ready to jet off to France or anything but I'm not a complete moron any more either. I'm calling that a huge success. Once this whole bachelors things is under my belt, I will be back to pick up the next level!!
1608299953,3.0,I'm not sure what the Rosetta Stone people were thinking when they started with their language products, but you would think that they could provide some hints of what the word they would like me to learn is in my native language.  Showing me a picture with a number of items in the picture and then asking me to repeat the word for one of the items in the picture isn't easy when you don't know "what item?"Also, after almost 2 months of the language, I've only learned the words for the professions of doctor, teacher, policeman & professor.  I understand this is common of their other language products as well.
1608299953,5.0,Rosetta Stone is an interesting concept for learning a foreign language. I speak a few different languages and have visited several foreign countries including France. I found it helpful to try to learn and speak in their native languages in order to blend yourself in different cultures. Before I started this program, I knew I would not have enough time to be fluent, but I wanted to be able to at least learn the basics and ask for directions and food and etc. I was able to do the program whenever I wanted, and for as long as I wanted. I could do it on a daily basis or even weekly. Even if I was busy and missed a few days or a week, the reviews were automatic, and quickly helped me get back up to where I left. The program was easy to set up and running quickly and I was able to learn how to read the basics, and get the vocabulary I needed right away, and I was able to construct sentences as soon as I started, and I was really amazed by how much the "Level 1" program got me through.
1608299953,3.0,The french words are spelled and pronounced but the english meaning of the word is not provided and is not always obvious - this makes memorization difficult
1608299953,1.0,I bought this product a little over a year ago. Now that I am done with it, I wanted to sell it. I put it on eBay and Craigslist. They had their lawyers contact the sites and have them remove the listing.Apparently in the tiny 4-point font disclaimers on the package it says that the license is not transferable, so you can't sell it as a used item after you're done with it.Total crap !
1608299953,1.0,I have spent 4 hours with support and am still not operational. I think they need to train their support people or just say they don't offer any support. It is the worst support I have experienced in 15 years of using computer software.
1608299953,1.0,This may be a way to learn a language? The user interface is inscrutably crummy. No pause button, no settings menu when you are into a lesson. The lesson template is OK once learned. No guidance on how to use the template. You are expected to know when to click or speak.They have so many fancy monikers for &#34;features&#34;.......I only wanted to learn the French language; not the Rosetta stone language.And it expires after 3 months.Worst setup of any program I've worked with in the last decade. And i write code. They give you 2 CDs and then send you to an online site.This teaching method is like trying to teach typing via the hunt and peck methodThere are many many free and less troublesome ways to get language capability.
1608299953,4.0,After using this application for a while now, I've come to realize two major things about it, and things it has helped (and not helped.)First, it helps recognize what words (or "root words") mean.  The picture-based learning approach seems awkward at first, but once you become acclimated to what it's attempting to do, you start using it almost like a super-easy memory game.  And that's where things work extraordinarily well.  A super-easy memory game...to learn a new language?  Rosetta Stone proves that it can be done.  Learning foreign plural forms, nouns, and verbs has never been quite so easy...except...The voice recognition works well, but at the same time, it's quite weird to see a word with 7 characters but you only actually make sounds for the first half of the word; granted, it can be like that because of the language...but after using Rosetta Stone, I feel like this bit of awkwardness is actually needed for any serious language learning software.  It *should* be weird at first.The biggest issues I have with the software was:1.  When you first start it up, you're kind of left thinking "Huh?  Where are the instructions in English?  How am I supposed to match the words (text and vocal) to a picture if I obviously have no idea what they're saying."  A short paragraph saying "here's what you're going to do now" would eliminate the feeling of "did I just skip something on accident?"2.  I'm not very far through it, so it may end up fixing the grammar and syntax later, but some of the words I still don't know what they actually are.  I can get the gist of them, but the matching isn't giving me a definite answer to the words I feel I'm somewhat learning.  (ie, Are the verbs all in the infinitive?)Overall, this is the best language software (and includes audio CD for on-the-go) that I've used, but at the same time, you're really not going to buy software, use it for a couple weeks, and then know everything.  The person wanting to learn (ahem, that's you) really needs to devote themselves and their time into doing it.  From what I've done thus far (not very devoted), I feel like I could understand a book written in French that was written for a 5-6 year old.  (While that may sound like an insult, coming in knowing no French whatsoever and using this software on-and-off for a while, it's actually a big heap of praise.)Would recommend as far as what the product does.  But if you're looking for the best value (perhaps if they'd stop advertising so much, they could lower the price), this is still a great product, but after buying a few Levels, you'd likely be better off taking a class instead.  (And have the motivation because you're "expected" to be there and you're trying to "earn a grade.")Overall...good software, and if you devote yourself to it, you'll likely be quite successful.
1608299953,1.0,Understand that if you purchase this product, your ability to use all the features has a 6 month time limit.  If you install and do not use the product promptly you will be told that half of the product will not work unless you pay $100+ for a subscription.  It does not matter if you have not used the online services at all, the money is gone, the service is gone, and you must pay more to use all of your product.  Customer service on this regard is not helpful at all.  Complete waste of money.Steer Clear.
1608299953,1.0,I got so frustrated after just 20 minutes with this program. There is no structure, no teaching of verbs and tenses. You are just listening and repeating phrases. Might be useful if I wanted to just have a mangled understanding of the language so I can order a croissant during a short trip to Paris, but not something that will help me develop a strong foundation of a new language.
1608299953,5.0,I've been reading rave reviews for Rosetta Stone for a long time and so when the opportunity to try it came up I jumped at it.You get a lot for your money:- Interactive Software for your Mac of PC- Audio Companion playable on CD Players on MP3- Custom headset that works with the software- Online access Card for Totale- iPhone Companion AppThe concept of Rosetta Stone is pretty simple, learn the language through a combination of spoken words, pictures and objects. Rather than learning the language through its building blocks you learn it through more practical and real world scenarios.  This helps tremendously if you want to use this set as a prep for travel (which I think this is very well suited for).The Rosetta Stone app has voice recognition so you can practice with the app itself. I found it to be pretty good although sometimes I had to repeat myself several times to get it right. Although the upside of this is that it made me speak more clearly which ultimately is a good thing.I really liked the Totale aspect of this edition. The Totale part is an online companion with games to play that I enjoyed.  Not all of them are blockbusters but there are enough to chose from that I found it to be worthwhile.  My favorite part of Totale was being able to chat with people who actually speak French natively. It's one thing to practice a language and quite another to ACTUALLY try to speak it with someone. I found the people to be very patient and the experience very positive.I'd definitely consider using Rosetta Stone in other languages to prep for trips abroad. Having some working knowledge of the language is very useful and the tools here are more than enough to get you on your way to speaking a language.
1608299953,1.0,I have purchased Spanish 1-5 and French 1, both software sets continually have the 2123 and 2125 errors.Although there is a 15 minute walk around of the errors, it is aggrevating to work around this glitch 15 minutes everyday before use.The support line is great, they are patient and will spend 2 hours on the phone to correct this error. BUT to only have the error return the next day.GREAT SOFTWARE WHEN IT WORKS!I will not purchase Rosetta Stone again because of this glitch.$1000 mistake.
1608299953,5.0,I really enjoy the Rosetta Stone software; it's easy and fun to use.  The Rosetta Stone "dynamic immersion" method is different than traditional methods where you see a word in English and then see a word in the new language to memorize.  L'&eacute;tude du franais est r&eacute;ellement amusement et facile!
1608299953,4.0,Unlike a lot of other media ways to try and teach you a foreign language, "Rosetta" teaches you the way you learned your 'native' language.  Like learning your numbers, you have to have a foundation of 'language' before you can be able to 'converse'.  If you have ever had a conversation with a five year old you get simple monosyllabic answers to questions.  That's because the child has not yet learned to integrate their knowledge.Example: If you ask a child what he/she wants for their birthday, they will say "ball". You ask what kind of ball, they say "round" because that's the first image that comes to mind with a ball.  It's not until nine or ten that they will say, "An NFL Professional size football" or "a major league baseball".The use of 'modifiers' is what makes words into conversation.  This is how Rosetta teaches you.Zeb Kantrowitz
1608299953,4.0,I'd heard about Rosetta Stone software for years now and I was very pleased with my experience with this beginning French software. Since I took French in college years ago, the beginning course was a review for me. The pictures are vibrant, the language clear, and the user-friendly approach made going through the lessons a pleasant experience. I didn't feel rushed through the lessons at all and the whole process played to my strenghts and weaknesses in the second language much like a glove would fit on one's hand. It seemed very natural and somehow specific to my needs as a learner. The headphones are of nice quality and the authentic input from native speakers comes through very clearly. If you are in need of a great review of a second language or if you desire to pick up a foreign language, I highly recommend Rosetta Stone software.The reason that I didn't give this software 5 stars, is that the voice recognition element doesn't seem to be quite accurate. At one point I was repeatedly missing a pronunciation of a word, and out of frustration I said the word with the worst French accent I could muster up, and lo and behold! The software gave me credit for the phrase. C'est la vie.
1608299953,3.0,Rosetta Stone seems to slowly build your knowledge base, but for learning some basic phrases etc that might be relevant to tourists, this is not your program. At this level, you learn how to say the man is running, the apple is red etc., but at least, so far, not a mention of information relating to travel. If you've never had French, there is no translation of words you may have never seen before. The &#34;live&#34; section is something you have to schedule with your teacher, and that may be hard for many as it has been for me. I took French in high school and one year of college and hoped this would be a good refresher. I do like the visual depiction of words and that you can play word games to aid in learning. Cost seems high. You can get many of the same things free with Duolingo.
1608299953,5.0,Process gets you thinking about the words. Not intimidating it just seems to get absorbed. Responses are sometimes problematic. May be due to being online and having bandwidth issues.
1608299953,5.0,I've never had french, learned french, or know anything about French. Now, however, I feel like I could do OK with a quick trip and to get around conversationally. Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning, but it's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- Doesn't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn't contain a whole lot- It's obviously pretty expensive. I guess if you're *really* interested, it's worth it.For it's purpose, it is almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this.
1608299953,1.0,After working with this software for months, I still could not put a single sentence together. After doing a lot of research, I tried another program and after just a few weeks I actually had a conversation with a friend (basic french of course).  What a waste of money Rosetta is.  Do your research folks.
1608299953,5.0,I have studied French in so many ways - classes, immersion videos, books, etc. - and I'm really impressed with this software. It's enjoyable, easy to breeze through, and immersion-based, which is the ideal right-brained way to learn a language. The extras are awesome. Highly recommended. The price is not that painful when you consider the cost of in-person instruction as a comparison.
1608299953,4.0,My daughter is a freshman in high school and is learning French. We have used Rosetta Stone in the past and find it to be a very good tool, but not if used on its own. Rosetta Stone teaches by immersion which is good, but not as thorough as we like. We use a workbook, a textbook and other online resources as well as Rosetta Stone to get a more thorough learning experience.
1608299953,5.0,Like that the price has finally come down on these language lessons. Great way to learn quickly and found it entertaining
1608299953,2.0,I got this as a gift, and I knew it would not work for me, which is why I didn't buy it for myself. I like to understand the fundamentals of the way a language works before I just start memorizing words by looking at pictures, and Rosetta Stone doesn't teach you anything about that. You just have to figure it out. I understand the whole concept of immersion, but you need some kind of background on grammar. Five minutes about grammar at the beginning of every new chapter would solve that problem. There are rules that are very basic, like if something ends in A, in Spanish, it's probably feminine. If it ends in O, it's usually, but not always masculine. Regular verbs are conjugated the same way. I love, you love, we love. He is, she is, they are, we are, etc. But Rosetta Stone doesn't teach you anything about the language. They just keep showing you pictures of people doing stuff or eating stuff, and hope that you catch on. I took 4 years of Spanish, and have become more fluent by speaking it. But i also know the rules of the language, so I can read things I haven't seen before. I practiced French and German from cd's  and from books. I learned more from listening to cd's in my car than than Rosetta Stone. There is something to be said for teaching someone how to at least conjugate basic verbs, or explain the differences in gender in nouns. Rosetta Stone is like a video game where you just click on answers, but they don't explain why the answers are wrong or right. You can use common sense to get through the levels without learning much about the language. Then, they give you spelling tests without explaining the special characters. I can't just memorize accent marks because they popped up on the screen. Tell me when accent marks are used in general, so that I can understand when to use them. I don't know how you would ever learn to write in French, because they don't teach you how. They don't explain how to pronounce things, and French has a lot of extra syllables that are silent. They need to explain when, and why, they are silent. They expect you to copy what the people on the recording do. But, copying isn't learning a language. I already had a background in French before i got this, and I was still confused.
1608299953,5.0,Rosetta Stone has a great way to learn a language. We have had many things get in the way of our studies and so we can't give much of a rating yet.
1608299953,4.0,La Femme Boit...... I think that means the girl drinks. Learned that in the first 5 minutes. :)Ok, overall the program is good. This was my first experience with Rosetta Stone software and I like it. They really did one heck of a job making learning fun and easy. I highly recommend the software if you want to learn a second language, it looks like it is a good product. I would definitely try other languages after seeing just how easy it is to use this stuff.What didn't I like?For starters the headphones and microphone that came with it are NOT quality, they are not comfortable and my ears got really hot. It was like wearing styrofoam balls over my ear[...]. Sure wish they headphones were at least padded better. The microphone seemed to work well, my only gripe here is the comfort of wearing it. And if you follow this program you will wear it a lot!Second, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to install the software. I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I sure would have like a faster, easier program to install. So don't think you can just pop this in and you are good to go, you need to first install the application, then install the language pack, then update it (if updates are available) then you need to scratch off the secret code and activate the product, then you have to setup your user profile and THEN you can finally get started.Overall the product is good, I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the software is really the key here. The headset is low quality and that takes away from the experience. I would almost they NOT provide a headset then provide the one they did. And second the install was lengthy. I got the french lesson, I don't want to have to install the application and then a language pack. The software should be smart enough to install both the app and language pack together to make the process even easier.And yes, I am a software developer so when I review software I look at it from a complete implementation standpoint. Software is only as good as the installer.
1608299953,5.0,I have always thought I was quite helpless when it came to learning other languages.  I am surprised to discover that I just might be able to learn French.  What I like about Rosetta Stone is it seems to approach learning through different layers, and it is helpful to see and hear words.I just started this process and am finding it helpful.  I also like that there are extra support via the internet community to work with other people using Rosetta Stone. Just a great product.
1608299953,5.0,Rosetta Stone 'Francais' is a wonderful way to learn the language.  Through immersion, it teaches the learner the basics of everyday French.  Because you are able to practice along with the program using a microphone, you are able to test you accent, pronunciation and timing as often as you'd like.  There are tests you can take for each section to see how you are progressing.  This helps you know whether you should repeat a section or proceed.  While the mainstream of the program is immersion, the words are also spelled out for those who like visuals.  It is a carefully thought out and well-designed program.
1608299953,5.0,Very simple & intuitive way to learn a language.After you complete the 10-minute installation, say `au revior' to English - everything from that point on is in French.The software is broken into modules that uses a building block approach to introducing new words.  You are shown a picture, the spelling, and the pronunciation for French words.  Depending on the exercise you select, you will click on a picture, speak the words, or write the words to select the correct answer - it's that easy.Level 1 is broken into 20 separate lessons.  After the introductory lesson, you can then select a vocabulary test, grammar test, speaking test, and writing test.  As the lessons progress, they get more complex to keep challenging you mentally.At only one point, we were confused with the interface.  After a few errant mouse clicks, we figured out what we supposed to do and we were able to progress.  If only I had remembered there is very comprehensive help available by pressing F1...The package comes with USB headphones and microphone, and two audio CDs to reinforce your learning.  You can easily rip these into mp3 format to use on your iPod or other mp3 players.My 11-year old son and I both started our own profiles.  I took four years of German in High School, but my son has never had any other foreign language training.  We both have been very successful at learning basic French thanks to Rosetta Stone.
1608299953,4.0,I don't like that the online is only good for three months.  It is slow to load when you stop after a lesson because it is tied to the internet.  I like the format for the most part.  I use it every day.
1608299953,3.0,I have heard many great things about Rosetta Stone, but always from the perspective of a TV ad with the usual, glowing testimonials of 30 and 40-somethings who just rave about the product.Naturally, I've always been curious, but have usually been put off by the near $200 price-tag that usually accompanies it.  So, when Amazon Vine had it on offer, I decided to give it a try.Here's what I have to say about it after a week's exposure to my wife (aged 40+) and my daughter (age 7).Generally speaking, Rosetta Stone does a great job in exposing kids to vocabulary.  Nouns are attributed to actual pictorial representations instead of the "x = y" approach.  This generally works well, as we do a better job with image recognition than we do with word matching.However, that being said, this kind of representation works well when you're in the early years of school where such learning applies.  As adults, however, we have already a well-established mind set where learning doesn't equate well to a kindergarten-level.  That's typically why we, as adults, sometimes have a hard time relating simple concepts to younger children simply because we tend to use constructs that are far more complex.In other words, while pictorial representations (i.e. "immersion") works well to introduce new and unfamiliar words to kids, this doesn't work well when it comes to grammar.  Sentence construction is best introduced in the traditional way of learning how to conjugate "-er" verbs in French by establishing simple rules (which account for 65% of the verbs in the French language).  Once those rules are learned, then it's quite easy to follow.Rosetta doesn't take this approach, which is why it hurts both kids and adults for altogether different reasons.  For kids, the immersion approach doesn't work simply because the rules need to be learned by memorization which is an adult concept.  Why do kids say things like, "I fell down and it hurtED"...?  Because they take a simple rule, apply it, and they don't realize why it doesn't work; i.e., the "immersion" aspect doesn't prepare them for exceptions to rules, rather than the rules themselves.  For the same reason, adults learn better from learning verb conjugation through rules, not immersion; immersion doesn't cover how to conjugate verbs through conditional tense, past imperfect, etc. and French actually has a number of rules that are easier to follow through rote memorization instead of "here you go...now speak!"That said, this is only Level 1.  However, I would say that it's a great vocabulary primer...I just wouldn't use it to teach grammar.Maybe it works well for others, which is why I give it the benefit of 3 stars.  Children may benefit from it more because of the general learning construct, but I would have to say that it fails to convey grammar effectively.  The company has been around for awhile.  But from someone who speaks both French and English and has actually seen the difference in learning between various ages, I am somewhat dubious about their claims.  Buyers should exercise caution.
1608299953,5.0,Rosetta Stone Version 3: French Level 1 sfotware is intutive and easy to use. It has different exercises to test both visual and reading comprehension. The software grades the user's performance and will work on problem areas. It is dynamic immersion - there is no english anywhere once the lessons begin.Two minor drawbacks (one style and one substance) hinder Rosetta Stone. The style issue involves the use of pictures. Rather than exclusively use cultural situations and settings, the pictures depict a myriad of cultural situations and settings. I suppose it is both cheaper and easier to do this when Rosetta Stone offers programs in 31 languages. The second issue involves the microphone and voice recognition software. Basically, it doesn't work. You can say almost anything and the program will grant you a passing score.
1608299953,5.0,Rosetta Stone,French Level One is an excellent starting point for learning the French language. Thank you very much formaking it available..
1608299953,1.0,My disks were defective and would not work in any outlet. The commercials on TV also had given the impression you could work the disks in your car and be speaking a new language after using the disks on a long trip. I don't see how this could be possible and use the computer as well.
1608299953,4.0,I've been using this product for about a week now. I've never taken any French classes before and wanted to try Rosetta Stone in hopes of attaining some basic language skills before an upcoming trip to Paris. At this point, I've been practicing for 45 minutes to an hour each day and am almost finished with the first unit (I think there are four or five units total in Level 1). I haven not attempted the games or live online tutoring yet, as I want to wait until I have a bit more practice under my belt.So far, I am pretty impressed with the software in general. As other reviewers have said, the style of learning is mainly picture-based, which seems to be working for me and would probably work for child learners as well. I've already learned a bunch of words and am speaking in basic sentences. For purposes of surviving a vacation to France, I think Rosetta Stone is the way to go. If I keep at this, I think I'll do pretty well asking for directions, ordering food in restaurants, and conversing with shopkeepers (there's an entire unit devoted to shopping which I haven't gotten to yet). However, people who are serious about learning the language from the ground up may be better off enrolling in an actual French language course with a real live instructor. While Rosetta Stone is teaching me basic vocabulary and sentences quickly, it doesn't explain grammar rules at all. The most confusing part for me so far is learning when to say things like "le" instead of "la" because Rosetta Stone just shows you what to use with certain words...it doesn't explain WHY. That has been frustrating for me and is making things more challenging as I progress through the lessons.Still, for my purposes, Rosetta Stone suits me just fine. More devoted scholars may want to look elsewhere, though.
1608299953,4.0,The Rosetta Stone process gets you involve through what they call immersion right away, and I found it quite fun.  You run the application and learning CD's through your computer, plug in your headset/microphone to the USB port, enroll on line for the web support and community and off you go.You can hear it, see it, see how your respond, and it pretty much sweeps you along and gets you quite involved.  I have learned languages(the Romance languages) traditionally in school and self-taught over the years, and I found Rosetta very helpful and engaging.The negatives are the price, and this is only Level One.  It's a fine start, but if you're serious, you're going to have to do a lot more work and dish out for the next level.  Your call!May I suggest, for quick learning, say for a trip: get a tape/cd and a book.  Learn the quick, important phrases, practice some everyday- use it, use it, use it- hear it and say it, and if you can, practice with a native speaker- you really learn that way, and you get over the nervousness of being ignorant about the language and constantly fretting about making mistakes.If you're willing to pay the price and put in time- some of us just love computer, and it also includes an Audio CD for practice elsewheres, the Rosetta Stone French will give you a good, fun start into French or any new language.
1608299953,5.0,Of all the romantic languages, French always seemed to me to be the most demanding and hardest to access. This system has given me a new appreciation for the language I was once scared of.The Rosetta Stone TOTALe packaging seemed big, until I opened it up and saw how much was crammed into the box:A nice USB headphone set, with built in microphone and padded ear cups.The actual Rosetta Stone software, for both Mac and PC, and the language specific lessons.Clear stick on labels for your keyboard (to help with the writing portion of the lessons).A CD/mp3 audio companion disc for practicing on the go or in your leisure time.A quick start guide.Authorization card to successfully install and use the software.Warranty information.The initial software install seemed to take a little bit of time, not more than 5 minutes though, but once it was finished the program started right up. The program automatically checked for software updates and gave me the option to download or continue with set up. I decided to download the update and I had to go through an installation for the update, but it went much more quickly than the first. Finally, after the program restarted and I selected the included microphone headset, I was asked to install the language I was working on.After placing the French I disc in and selecting the course, the program prompted that my drive only had space for 3 total courses (French I, II, and III), each at about 600mb. Hard drives are getting cheaper, but I thought it was worth noting that the entire French I course (this set you're looking at) is going to take about 600mb of space; I know that hard drive space can be an issue for some people.I was asked to input the activation code found on a card inside the package. I put the code in and the program connected online to verify it was legitimate.  When the authorization was complete, I was asked to fill out a profile, with my name and date of birth. I was given the option to also take part in the online sessions, which would allow me to practice my new skills with people proficient in the language. I noticed that I was offered a free 3 month trial period. I opted not to sign up for that feature, so I can't comment on its performance. Finally, there was a short introductory video (which I skipped since I'd already watched it online), at that point I was free to start my lessons.I picked the extended reading, writing, and speaking lessons, but there were options for reading and speaking only or reading and writing only, and so on. The core lesson takes you through the basics of the language, doing so only in French. It's full immersion and I was awestruck at how quickly I was picking things up, especially having never studied French. The use of descriptive images and repetitive audio cues, had me speaking a language and knowing what I was saying in matter of minutes. In less than ten minutes I knew several nouns and 3rd person pronouns, both male and female, and their spelling and I had gained the ability to spell and pronounce a number of activities (reading, drinking, eating, running, etc.). It was inspiring to feel successful, especially when half way through the lesson the words disappeared from the screen and I had make the right connections using what I had just learned.When all is said and done, I know I'm not going to be able to move to France and be mistaken as a native because of my excellent pronunciation and conversational skills learned from this program, but as a foundation for further learning and studying, it would be hard to beat this system. I would recommend it for all learners, young and old. I'm excited to learn more French!
1608299953,4.0,First off, I need to mention that I received this product via the Amazon Vine program for use and review, and I would like to say that this is a very nice, natural and easy way to learn French.  Very enjoyable.Through the use of "Dynamic Immersion" or, by viewing images of places and situations and through repetition from audio prompts, I am able to quickly learn basic French in just a very short session.  I like the speech recognition and the fact that I can use live interactive sessions with native tutors.I have had training in Spanish in the past via the "old school" method of conjugating verbs, tenses, etc., but with the Rosetta Stone method of training, I have experienced a fresh, new and different way to learn a new language ... it's actually fun!This software is a bit pricey, but if you want to learn French using a natural, simplistic, easy and intuitive way ... then this just might be the program you are looking for ... Recommended.
1608299953,3.0,I completely agree with another review that "children learn this way, not adults." It's true.While doing level 1, after each lesson I was wondering when I was going to learn the basics of French, like say, how to say what your name is or ask how someone is... a va? None of that is covered in level 1. (And so far not in level 2 either...) It's just a bunch of nouns overall. It teaches items and things VERY well, but not how to speak or understand French, which is what I thought was going to happen. The images are super helpful with stuff like that. Picture of a fish >> poisson! Great. But they then throw a bunch of weird grammar at you and you're supposed to know what the difference is between nous and vous by the end, but that didn't happen. It is quite confusing. I found myself keeping Google Translate open so I could understand what exactly the word was that I was being taught.A really, really great thing about Rosetta though is the audio/speaking part. You don't get that with a book. It is a huge plus, but not enough.Instead I have been using textbooks and activity books, and in a few hours have learned more about the basics of French than Rosetta's French Level 1 taught me. I did get some good rrrrrrrrrrrrr practice out of Rosetta though.There is no way you can learn a language through this "immersion" crap. I honestly could not even say hello, how are you, and goodbye after Level 1. The price is also completely ridiculous for how primitive it is.Using this ALONG with some books is great (just for pronunciation really), but alone is not worth that hefty price tag.Bonne chance.
1608299953,4.0,First off, let me say that I like how this software works.  It's got good voice recognition software and the use of pictures and the way it tests you to make sure you understand what's going on, allows users to build vocabulary quickly.Note:::There will be a portion of the population, like myself, that will absolutely need to have the system of conjugation written down for them to `see' the logic of it, but that doesn't really detract from the software in my opinion.What does detract is the "beta" feel of the administrative part of the software.  Installation and maintenance have been a royal pain in the tuckus.I think my husband described it best when he said:  `Their software is very tightly scripted, but not very adaptive.  If your system is at all different from what the Rosetta Stone programmers anticipated, you will on the phone with the help desk for considerable time.'  That said, their help desk was helpful.INSTALLATION:::  Installation wasn't all that smooth for us.  After we installed the software, it gave us a notice that we needed to upgrade our O/S (a new service pack) and a new version of the Rosetta Stone software's engine. Plus there was some difficulty getting the headphones working, but I can't recall now exactly where the problem lay.MAINTENANCE:::  Yes, who knew there was maintenance.True to form, everything was running exceedingly smoothly for my husband, myself, and my 10 year-old daughter UNTIL the pop-up of death appeared that demanded that it be allowed to install an update.  Being a cautious soul I tried to back out as I `didn't want an update thank you', but guess what.  The software would no longer work.  No more French learning without the update :(Well, since that was a no go, I allowed the  update.  And guess what.  No more French learning.  In fact, the update hosed things up for a good long while, at least until someone had time to call the help desk and spend a good hour fixing the problem.It was amazing how much information was needed to do this.  We had to give the tech not only the Rosetta Stone key, but also  everything about our computer including the clock rate. Go figure. I suppose they are adding to their database trying to narrow in on where the problems are coming from.In any case, it turned out that there was a hidden file that needed to be deleted.  This file told the system that the upgrade was in progress, when in fact it had failed.  There was also a problem that stemmed from the fact that we have different profiles on this particular computer.  One for adults, one for kids.  In the end though that was resolved as well.THE SKINNY:::You are probably surprised by the 4-Stars I've given this program.  But honestly I don't think there's anything that compares to the Rosetta Stone method of learning.My advice would be to only install this software on a newer machine and if possible not allow that computer to connect to the internet until you are ready to use the online features.  These, by the way, will only work with one profile.Pam T~mom/newish French student
1608299953,3.0,Rosetta Stone and Berlitz are perhaps the most well known language learning programs available today. I have never used Berlitz so I can't compare the two. However Rosetta Stone is OK and if you persevere you will eventually learn the language of your choice. Keyword being eventually. However I found that for me the Pimsleur language lessons were much easier to learn from, even though they don't have the brand name recognition that Rosetta Stone does.Others have commented on the copy protection and ability to use the program after a certain day regardless of when you actually first begin using the program so I won't repeat those concerns.If you care about brand name then go with Rosetta Stone, but if you don't care about brand name and just care about functionality go with Pimsleur.
1608299953,4.0,I have had this product for a while to evaluate because I have so enjoyed the format and the refresher course. I have 7 years of high school and college French but like so many Americans, I never learned to speak or aurally interpret native speech properly. I found the visual and sound exercises extremely helpful and enjoyable. I have been through the entire course multiple times and found that I was able to put a DVD on "French" and actually understand much of what being said. I'm not sure I'd learn formal French grammar this way but I don't think that is the point of the course.I was disappointed that I could not get the speech recognition microphone function to work despite many weeks of attempts, use of customer service and other techie help. My computer is quite up to the task and so was I but I was never able to get that working. Even so, the parts of the course I was able to access were very enjoyable and enhanced my French skills. Merci!Based upon this experience, I'd definitely consider buying the next course if I could be assured the voice recognition piece would work.
1608299953,5.0,I don't do French myself but my granddaughter wanted this for a long time. I suppose I'll have to take her to France next.
1608299953,5.0,Easy to use..great value. My wife really likes it. Now she has taken up french cooking. What will be next?
1608299953,5.0,Seamless installation and a great product. It is true reflection of their world class brand. I am looking forward to buy level 2 onwards for French very soon
1608299953,5.0,Rosetta Stone V4 French is better than a college class, better than any other language-learning system, certainly better than any combination of books and CDs. Not only is RS as effective as immersing yourself fully in another language, it's effective in the SAME WAY as moving to Paris or Frankfurt or Rome. You learn the way a baby learns, no translations, just examples and repeated emphasis. Brilliant, brilliant, BRILLIANT, and the new online component makes it a social experience as well! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
1608299953,5.0,My 11-year-old daughter asked for this for Christmas as part of her ultimate goal of going to Paris.  I have both of us set up as users on the software.  First, the installation was simple.  I was surprised to find stickers for the keyboard for the special characters.  And, there are worksheets that you can print out for additional practice.  One thing that is not mentioned on here that I could find, is there are 2 versions of the software.  We have the homeschool version.I saw and heard her speaking French very soon after she started.  I thought that it might be a good idea for me not to depend on her in a foreign country, so I started learning also.  I don't think that I've heard one word of English and I am half way through this level.  Most of the lessons are self explanatory.  I have really enjoyed the lessons and feel like I could at least start to figure out what's going on when we get to France.Pros:-Easy to understand.-Builds on itself nicely.-Repetition to help remember.-Doesn't start at the alphabet & numbers like they do in schools.Cons:-Expensive!-The workbook is 100 pages long and must either be printed or the answers written on paper.-It has occasionally been a little tough to figure out what you're supposed to be doing.-It's not very fond of a light southern accent.-Maybe a little too much repetition for an adult.Ultimately, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn a new language. People learn differently and maybe that is the issue that other adults are having with it.Now I just have to save my pennies (approx. 50000 of them) so I can get the other levels.
1608299953,5.0,Bring French to life!If your child is taking their first year of French or you are ready to head off on vacation and want to learn the language yourself, Rosetta Stone is a great learning tool for you both!  Version 4 comes with the learning lessons, headset with mic, app to use with your iPhone or iPod Touch for on the go learning and access to a virtual community online for lessions, games and chat!  I really don't think you can ask for more from a product.My only regret is that I didn't know about this product sooner! I certainly would have bought it for each one of my children throughout their schooling! What a GREAT product for homeschooling as well!
1608299953,5.0,Normaly, when using language products, there is a bit of a learning curve, but I learned things so quickly that it was like there was no curve at all!
1608299953,4.0,Enjoyable and easy to use, does have some difficulty understanding french with an Australian accent, but on the whole a very useful tool to improve and practice you french.
1608299953,5.0,I have invested a lot of money in "canned" language programs over the years and have found Rosetta Stone to be the best.  It is easy to load, is intuitive and produces great results.  I like that I was able to purchase a level at a time and the true multi-dimensional aspect of how I was able to learn French.  I will definitely purchase and work my way through the other levels in the future.  The user friendly nature of this program and it's realistic approach makes it enjoyable to use!Rosetta Stone French Level 1
1608299953,4.0,I took one semester of French in college so I could read French poetry and literature for my BA and MFA classes.  I learned enough to figure out words in reading, but didn't excel much at the oral part.  I tried this item out for that.  The other one I had for review was the Spanish one.  I gave it one star less than this, though it is pretty much the same program.  I learned more with this kit than the Spanish one, since I took four years of Spanish in high school and retain a lot of it still.  I am still not sure about how to find how much the online lessons are once my trial period of three months that you get free with the kit is over. It is hard to find on the website.  I like the games and layout of the Rosetta Stone program and I am a visual learner and this helps me with the oral part as well.  I like to see as I speak, which is hard to do with audio programs.  This has audio CDs for the car, video games for my computer and online help once I get my French up to speed.  My only complaint about this program is that you can only install in on one computer, so I have one of these on my laptop and the Spanish one on my home computer, since it takes up a good chunk of memory.  I would like the option to put these on any new computers I buy years from now, but RS has a very limited use.  It's like buying a course.  If you have a computer you will use for 5-6 years, it is really worth it.  If you work at home in a field where you need to upgrade your computer more often, you might be disappointed that you can't put it on your new computer.  I wish RS would allow at least this to be installed on two computer, in case the computer you are using fails.This is like taking one semester of French, beginner level, in high school or college.  I learned about the same thing I did in the French course in college and it is less money to do it this way.I think if you are a visual learner, you will like this product.  There is a lot of debate that kids learn better this way, but I think adults can too.  Mind you, that this teaches you very basic French and not beyond present tense really.  Just like a college course.  I like that I can see the words and tend to repeat them better when I see a picture at the same time.  Or maybe I am just a child at heart!Note: I have been using this and another Rosetta Stone for several weeks now and the headset that comes with it has a microphone that isn't so good. Or maybe with use had become not so good. Both my boyfriend and I have trouble getting the microphone to register words we say, even if we say it correctly. For example, even simple Spanish words like Si and Hola get a negative signal even though I am saying it perfectly. I continue at the same volume about 5 times and then, it finally takes it. I wonder if it will become frustrating on high levels where you have to repeat back longer sentences. My Mac doesn't have an external mic, so I have no option but to use the headset and take it off to speak as loud as I can into the microphone. It doesn't seem to matter if I do their "1,2,3,4,5" test at regular voice, louder or softer. After having to repeat one word twenty times before they accept it, even though I know I am doing it right, tires me out!
1608299953,5.0,I got this product for my sister who enjoyed taking 4 years of French in high school.  Here is what she had to say about the product:>>>THIS IS AMAZING! I loved working with this product! I picked up on the words and phrases very quickly, and it was fun to do. They show you pictures and then show you the French word, pronounce it for you, and then you say it. It reviews the same things in different ways so practicing the words is not dry and boring. You can do it on your time and at your own pace. It also teaches you the four areas of language - speaking, listening, reading and writing. It offers activities that have you practice a combination of skills (reading and writing over listening and speaking), as well as lessons that focus on just one of the skills. I would highly recommend this product to my fellow peers! I am excited to try French Level 2 and learn even more!&lt;&lt;&lt;I asked her if she had tried any other language learning products that she could compare it to and she said she had not, but she was very happy with this.
1608299953,3.0,There are different ways learning, hearing, record and sight. It goes into sentences when I had to guess what they were doing. (When you get it wrong it doesn't not tell you what you click on. So you are not learning by your mistakes).ex The boy is running said it french. It will show you a boy jumping boys running, boy running, and a girl swimming. I would like to know what the noun and verb is before I hear sentences. Babbel.com breaks it down better, but it starts going into something I probably won't ever use.
1608299953,5.0,.When in the military,  I was stationed in Europe for several years.  The friends I made had a quiz they liked to use: "What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual;  What do you call a person who speaks two languages?  Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.  Then I will tell them I am "quadri lingual.".  Do you think that will work? . . . Neither do I.
1608299953,1.0,Only has limited use on the apps i bought this for.  After six-months a subscription is required.  Also, nothing that special about the Rosetta Stone method.
1608299953,3.0,Arrived quickly, was fairly easy to set up, and seemed easy to use at first. It took awhile to figure how to use the product and I am still evaluating it. I don't like that it opens every time I boot up my computer, but that may be something I did. I will buy more levels if I find this one works. At this time the jury is still out so to speak....I would recommend buying only level one until you find out if this format works for you. It may cost more, but can same money if you find the program does not fit your learning style....
1608299953,2.0,I didn't stick with it very long.I did  learn a little French.I would like to go back to it later.
1608322130,4.0,Purchased this onsie for a future soccer player.  The expecting mother has played soccer for 30 years, girls/women's indoor and  outdoor, as well as on mixed leagues.  I expect her future daughter will be a soccer star just like her mother.  SCORE.
1608322130,1.0,I was under the impression that I was receiving the onesie and the jersey shown in this listing especially when it says soccer outfit.  Only getting the onesie makes this a horrible deal.
1608322130,5.0,This little outfit is adorable for any soccer-loving family. It's very cute and I would recommend buying it if you have soccer fanatics in your life.
1608322130,2.0,I bought this onesie as my son's Halloween costume.  I went as a soccer player and he was my soccer ball.  (Don't worry, I carried him in my arms and never put him on the ground in case anyone thought he was a real ball.)  The onesie is adorable, but it was definitely too pricey for what it is.  I would not buy another one of these onesies unless they brought the price down, significantly.
1608322130,5.0,Very cute soccer onesie for new baby.  When baby arrives he will be wearing this to his daddy's soccer games.
1608322130,5.0,Well, I was expecting a onesie, based on the photograph on the outside of the package but I got a 2T shirtinstead.  I really love the cute soccer ball shirt though so I was not disappointed.  It's a little bit expensive forwhat you get but you will never find this in a retail store so it was worth it.
1608322181,5.0,I'm very sorry; I reviewed this item as defective (with a little hole in it) but I was mistaken, it was another item with this problem bought of a different seller. I'm proud to inform that this item, from Bambino Balls is in perfect conditions and five star worthy. Thank you.
1608322262,5.0,We LOVE this onsie! Our baby is due to arrive any day, so he wont be too old for his first Halloween. We wanted to do something simple since he'll be so young/tiny, and this will be perfect! :)
1608322262,5.0,My baby wore this at 3 weeks old for a Super Bowl party with a pair of knee high baby socks and she looked great!  The newborn size did seem to run a little big.  She was born at 7lbs, so she was probably around 7 or 8lbs when she wore it, and it was baggy, but still cute.  Good quality.  Everybody loved it!
1608322262,5.0,We are sharing the baby news with our football-loving family this week by giving them this onesie, it could not be cuter!!!
1617160040,4.0,I have mixed feelings about RS. These reviews should be about the learning aspect of RS, not technical difficulties. I have had a couple of minor glitches, but RS customer service was responsive.I understand the methodology. In a nutshell, I feel that even minimal information on verb tenses or sentence structure or article usage would be incredibly helpful. Fortunately, my Austrian friends are there to help me (although they seem to think I'm silly to try to learn German when they are happy to speak English to me when I visit!). One friend sent me to this [...] to help me understand. It was very early on in Level 1 that I was confused by all the endings added on without explanation. Yes, you may pick up the patterns at some point, but a bit of explanation would be easier.That said, there is so much repetition, you need not fear the next lesson. And it is pretty enjoyable on the whole. I grew up hearing a little bit of German/Yiddish, so the pronunciation has been easy for me. I am a bit fanatical about accents, so I want to get it right. I am bugged that occasionally the voices will differ during the lesson. Ex.: the pronunciation lessons for 'und' and 'fahrrad' make clear that you hit the D pretty much like a T; but when the female voice says 'fahrrad,' she says it like a D.  Same with 'und'--the male voice says it as a D in one phrase.It's hard to imagine becoming anywhere near fluent without the rules and such, but I'm reviewing Level 1, so that's not for me to say.The headset is very nice and solid. So why does each new level come with one?? What a waste! Offer the option of buying the software and using the headset we have.
1617160040,4.0,I'm still in one of earlier sections.  There is repeating and combining of earlier sections with new sections.  This gives you continuous reinforcement.  However, sometimes new words or structure are presented and it can be difficult to understand the purpose of new material.  A German/English dictionary would be handy.  I found Skype and Rosetta to have a conflict over microphone control.  I had to make sure Skype did not launch before I could use the built in mic on my web cam would work.
1617160040,2.0,My husband bought me this for my birthday.  I used this for months, as I had German friends traveling to the US and wanted to be able to offer conversation in their native language.  This software fell short (by a long shot).  The pictures work well, but at times can be confusing.  Often, no matter how I spoke a phrase, it would tell me I'm incorrect, conversely, at times when I've been horribly off, I've gotten credit.  The software is easy to use, and reliable, but even receiving a response from their team is like pulling teeth. I had contacted them numerous times for explanations (there's no key or anything textual for me to use as reference other than an alphabet references, just pictures...and figuring those out can be a difficult task as well) and was given very generic responses that led me nowhere.  As the lessons went on, the language became more confusing.  There were articles and demonstratives that were extremely confusing, and I couldn't figure out if they were based on the object or gender/plurality of those speaking (nominative, etc).  I received no verification from Rosetta, simply referring to the dictionary reference, which was of no help. I even attended an online Q&A, which they glossed over my question without an answer! They quickly read it and basically, nonchalantly, referred back to the above, unhelpful reference I was given before. Given the amount you pay for this software, they should provide other pertinent lessons on what I've mentioned (it's an entire topic that could be lent to itself). I was constantly bombarded with emails and pop-ups trying to get me to buy more support or more software, yet I couldn't get anyone to answer my questions and often had to use Google Translate or a plain search on the internet. I think German is quite difficult for a native English speaker to grasp with just this software.  I would recommend this if you have a basic knowledge of a particular language, as it's good for brushing up.  But, for me (and for German), I would not recommend Rosetta Stone. It was much more helpful to do YouTube searches and speak to my German friend over Skype (though frustrating).
1617160040,5.0,I don't know how or why Rosetta Stone works as well as it does, but it is magic.  After years of struggling through conventional language programs my son is flying through German and his best friend is zooming through Spanish and both boys are showing real facility with the process and the verbal responses.  I have never seen students expressing themselves so quickly or more confidently in a foreign language.  Hats off!
1617160040,4.0,I am a native English speaker and I bought the Rosetta Stone German Level 1-5.  I am currently learning Level 1 so I see it only fair to review this. The sequential software will come when I have completed each one of them.The hardware was fine and the headset isn't flimsy.  It's much better than any headphone or headset I bought for myself, but that doesn't mean it can't break or get glitches.  My only (tiny) hardware irk is that all the Audio companions is on a DVD data disc so I had to burn CDs in order to listen to this in my car.  (My iPod is barely used and stays at home.)I had no problems installing the software or getting my computer to recognize the headset.To quote myself in another comment:"I own a 64-bit Windows Vista and I have separate speakers and headset apart from the headset. The only issue that I ran into is that when I installed the the Rosetta Stone software, it automatically defaults ALL sounds through the headset. I didn't realize this until I started playing my music and trying to video chat. This can be adjusted through Control Panel > Hardware & Sounds > Sound (Right-click this icon and create a shortcut onto your desktop!). In the sound control panel, there will be a "Playback" tab and a "Recording" tab. (Sorry XP, Win7, Snow Leopard, and all Mac users. Hopefully you get the gist.)"Rosetta Stone works; but I am the type of learner where complete immersion, repetition, and activities work.  If you have access to Rosetta Online, I recommend the Bingo game and going through the stories.  When using Stories, first listen to it and try to visualize every said detail, then read it.  Doing this paired with the Audio has helped me tremendously.I do find problems with pronunciation. Some of my pronunciation errors are right, but there are a few (e.g. alt, Jahre, Bruder, Englisch) that I have to over-exaggerate certain (wrong sounding) noises to get it to accept. That is REALLY frustrating because I don't hear what I'm incorrectly saying.  What's also frustrating is that it'll accept many other words that I'm nowhere near to pronouncing correctly.  "Uuuuuuh..." is sometimes accepted! The pronunciation quirks pester me the most when using this program, but I can't say I run into them too much where it deters me from wanting to continue through the lessons.The Milestones at the end the four units are a bit intimidating especially if you don't use the online resources.  I am usually at a lost for what to say.  It's not obvious all the time.  In this situation, just remain silent.  The program will think there's an error with the microphone. When you have formed the sentence in your mind, continue with the activity.I never use this program without Google Translate opened next to it.  I don't use it to decipher whole sentences or phrases, just a couple words here and there.I don't lean too hard on Google for interpretation because after a while, a learner will see that German words do not correlate to just one meaning.  "Sie" can mean she, you, they, it and so on. The meaning depends on the overall sentence.  So it's important to try to think German and try not to interpret every word directly to English.  Rosetta Stone does a good job of giving visuals to let you think in German, but it does not explain any of the Grammar or word rules.  This is why I'm shopping for a German grammar book on Amazon.EXAMPLE: The more I research, the more I see how important it is to when to use "sie" and "du". Both mean "you," but one is formal and good for strangers and the other is used among friends and family.  And my understanding is that depending on what "you" we use makes a difference on the spelling of other words in the same sentence.As someone has mentioned, there's no glossary of words in Rosetta Stone.  So when I want to double-check my spelling or the words I'm using, I have to use Google Translate.****CORRECTION UPDATE**** There is a document of words and phrases learned.  It's located on the CD under "Documentation". ****July 12****Overall, I am very pleased with this program and the progress that I am making.  The price is fair to me because it cost less than taking a semester course at my local college and I can access this as many times as I want... whenever I want. Rosetta Stone isn't totally complete with everything you need; and that's why I pair it with Google and other books and tools.  However, that doesn't mean that this doesn't work or isn't worth your investment.  If you understand that learning a language takes constant work and you are determined to teach yourself, buy this. This software is like a teacher.  And since I'm a student, it is up to me to do my homework.
1617160040,5.0,I have been wanting to learn a new language for some time and finally bit the bullet deciding on this language and this product. Rosetta really does make it easy to learn. I will continue with these lessons and can easily see myself utilizing Rosetta Stone in the future for new language experiences!
1617160040,4.0,Every winter I tend to hibernate for a couple of months and when I do I always seem to pick up some obscure new interest; for a while there it was the idea that I'd learn to speak German. I'd seen the Rosetta Stone program demonstrated at a kiosk in Grand Central Terminal in NYC and it seemed to be a reasonable investment in getting to know how the program works for me while building some basic vocabulary. I like that it appeals to both my visual learning style and that you can increase the difficulty of pronunciation fluency.Level One covers some pretty basic stuff - things like "newspaper", "egg" and very easy/common words that you would likely learn early on if immersed in the culture you are studying, which is where I agree with the product description. The headset works with decent reliability but sometimes does not want to let me "pass" on a certain word no matter how many times I've said it or how accurate I think I am. I like that the program is based around pictures and spoken word. Since this is just level one I am not sure if this is the best way to learn to speak a new language entirely; for me, this "flash card effect" is a good way to learn and reinforce new vocabulary though.If you are planning on ordering more levels it might be advisable to check what deals are offered directly by the company, as they have offered some satisfaction guarantee or money back with certain packages. Either way you should have at least 30 days through Rosetta Stone or Amazon to see if this might be a good fit with no risk if it does not suit your learning style. I happen to think this program is worth a try.
1617160040,5.0,My husband is having a great time learning, the lessons are short and fun. We are ready to buy the others!
1617160040,4.0,Alright, for once a product lives up to the hype! It is FUN. Doesn't feel like a chore. So intelligently designed! I'm looking forward to future modules.
1617160040,5.0,It is Rosetta stone what can be better than that? Bringing that high school German at level 1. Buy it.
1617160040,1.0,My family purchased Rosetta Stone German 1 for me and I must say it is a complete disappointment because I am unable to get past the microphone set-up screen.  We tried the info in the "help" section which did not help at all.  We have contacted Rosetta Stone with no response.  Keep in mind that after 3 months the online portion goes away unless you pay another fee.  Can't understand why it it so difficult to even get started.  (I also have Pimsleur which is much simpler, so looks like that is how I will be learning German).
1617160040,5.0,Purchased this item for a upcoming trip to Germany to meet family members and relatives.  Did not speak a word of German.  Now after 6 weeks and 8 weeks to go until our trip I am confident that I will do just fine with the simple dialoging that will be going on.  Rosetta Stone is amazing.  The customer service was beyond helpful and I and my husband (who is brushing up on his German from high school and college) will be just fine when we meet our family there for the very first time.I highly recommend Rosetta Stone and when we complete Level 1 - we will surely move on to the remaining levels.  Worth every penny.
1617160040,2.0,Unfortunately, I'm not actually able to rate the software itself because it never ran on my Windows 8.1 PC - producing the Fatal Application Error #1141.  All available fix options suggested on the Rossetta support site have been tried without success.  Writing support, it was suggested that I remove my antivirus and anti-malware software.  Even if that were to be successful, it would still be an unacceptable `solution' since it would be useless and dangerous to run the PC without them -- just so I could run Rosetta software.  The internet has many, many people making the same complaint -- and many of them are using protection software other than what I'm using (Zone Alarm and MalWarebytes) .  I even tried it on two different PC's.  The second PC runs windows 7.0.  The same result occurred.If it works for you, that's great.  It doesn't for me.
1617160040,1.0,I bought this for my wife. Our computer is about 6 years old, WIN XP, SP3. I've tried to get it loaded, but it wouldn't load. So I uninstalled it. I tried again. Same result. I decided not to waste my time with it anymore. I am handicapped, and it takes me a long time to type, too long for a chat-type service. Maybe Geeek squad can help.
1617160040,5.0,I am planning on a trip to Germany and want to learn as much of the language as I can.  This course is really, really helpful.
1617160040,5.0,The product arrived safely, and is great! I am very pleased with this program. It is very informative and keeps you interested and motivated to continue on with the program.
1617160040,2.0,Open the box and did the install and nothing worked. The language CD would not load. That killed the evening I had set aside for the beginning lesson. I took it to work the next day and spent 2 hours trying to get it to load and the Tech Support people had to work for an 1/2 hour on the phone just to get the thing to begin working. Huge pain,,,,,,Loss of time,,,,,,,,,ruined my attitude about buying any follow up lessons.
1617160040,1.0,I do not have the rest of my life to guess at how you use the phrases. I hate that I ordered the whole program...however they do worry you to death trying to sell you other things.
1617160040,5.0,It worked fine for a couple days, then the microphone stopped working. I tried a different microphone - it still doesn't work. I googled the problem and I see that it is widespread - on Windows, Linux, and Apple. I haven't been able to find a solution.I have ordered Tell Me More German, which looks like a much better product.Update on July 5:  The mike works now.  I bought more levels.  I'm up to Level 3.  Now I love Rosetta Stone!  (Tell Me More German is gathering dust.)
1617160040,5.0,Our whole family is enjoying this great learning tool!  It's easy and fun to use and makes learning a foreign language a breeze!
1617160040,5.0,This is an absolutely wonderful German language learning product. I can't imagine it could be any better. I learned a lot and can't wait to start the next level
1617160040,5.0,Rosetta Stone is almost miraculous and it has been stunningly effective in helping to master the German language.  I purchased the program a few years ago in preparation for a dream trip to Germany.  Within a very short time and with minimal effort on my part, I had more than mastered German, I was speaking it like a native.  I know this because so many people in Germany were shocked to learn I am an American and often refused to believe my accent was not Bavarian.  A few even insisted I was a native German and were adamant I must be joking.  When I told people that I was making my first visit to Germany and was from California, it was not unusual to see a shake of the head accompanied by a hearty laugh.  While there, I had no problem reading train schedules, maps, or even a bit of Goethe when a new German friend recommended him.  I especially enjoyed Wagner when I attended the Bayreuth Opera festival and am very glad indeed that I made that side trip.  Rosetta Stone has broadened my horizons and flung open so many cultural doors that I can not begin to recommend it enough.  Considering my desire to speak and read German simply began with my interest in World War II, it is truly wondrous how much more I have learned there is to German art and culture.  There is certainly more to this beautiful country than militarism and goosestepping parades of troops.  Once one masters the language, entirely new and magnificent vistas come into view.  The subtlety of the tongue introduces you to a warm and loving people who have been deeply misunderstood, often due to communication barriers and semantics.  Rosetta Stone offers the opportunity to all of us to grow closer to one another and to embrace all of humanity through language.  I am currently mastering Japanese and plan to move on to French shortly.  Perhaps the most significant thing I have learned through the wonder that is Rosetta Stone is that there are no limits to what I am capable of learning and to never again turn away from an intellectual challenge.  Even in middle age, it is both easy and fun to learn any new language and to become as fluent as you wish.  Already my Japanese neighbor has asked me how many years I lived in Japan as a child and if I went to school near Kyoto!
1617160040,4.0,I took German over many hears in Germany and without a foundation, this system would not be simple to understand as a second language, but it has been helpful to get my head back in the second language game.It doesn't start with &#34;man = ***&#34;, or &#34;woman = *** &#34;....Or it doesn't say &#34;the = *** &#34;, or &#34;it = *** &#34;....It just starts things off.... and if I didn't know the extreme basics, I would've gotten no where.Otherwise, I like learning with it.
1617160040,5.0,I was surprised how quickly I was able to learn vocabulary and pronounciation without hearing or reading the English word equivalent.  The method works very well.
1617160040,5.0,This was purchased as a gift and certainly exceeds our expectations.  It is easy to install and seems to be helping in learning the language!
1617160040,5.0,I am very pleased with Rosetta Stone V4 TOTAle German Level One, and the approach that is taken to teaching a foreign language.  There is no English used in any of the lessons; it is only the German language associated with pictures, and the  reinforcement of my pronunciation through the voice recognition software.  It is a non-stressful way to learn a language -- and it's fun!..
161716013X,4.0,I had used Rosetta Stone before to learn Spanish. The greek was put together just as nicely. My only complaint is that with Spanish the letters are so similar to English that the reading and writing portions were simple. However, with Greek the letters are so different you have no idea what the words are saying and there was no training on the letters themselves. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend. However, I would recommend using online tools to learn the letters and their sounds before hand.
161716013X,1.0,I have given this one star, not because I hate it, but as a rating in comparison to Total Greek.  If you get Rosetta Stone you will need to use a Greek Dictionary and have a tutor to help you interpret what is going on.  If you just wing it without, you will never really understand what you are doing.  You have photo's and sentences and words, but there is no explanation as to what Rosetta Stone is doing or why.  In my humble opinion, it would not be too difficult to make a better product than Rosetta Stone.  All you would need to do is offer some explanations as well as use a different format in some cases.  An advantage is found in the use of the text to speech verification.  However, as for the photos, it is a nifty idea, but the TV is a better visual medium then this, and it is no help at all. So photos alone are not the answer, although it is good idea.  Rosetta Stone also has various glitches.  For example, there will be a sentence, and you have to match it with a photo.  After you get the answer correct there is no way to *easily* check to see what was said in writing without going back where all the sentences are flashed off in the beginning.  They also use the same format for every language, I really question how committed they are to teaching the best way for each language.  I hear they throw in TV and other such things in Latin.There is a WIDE MARGIN for improvements here, so keep your eyes open for the next product, I know I will.  In the mean time get some Greek friends and purchase  Total Greek.  When you finished THEN I would say you can go back to Rosetta Stone.  For example to do it the other way around would be such a waste of time I cannot even make a compassion.
161716013X,4.0,This is a good product to get you started.Easy to work with as you really need to complete the lessons multiple times to get the pronunciations correct. It is helpful to be able to back to the beginning for practice.
161716013X,5.0,This is such an improvement over previous versions. I really enjoy the content as well as the options to talk with native speakers as you progress through the program.
161716013X,5.0,I have had this Rosetta Stone Greek level 1 for about 2 weeks now and I love it. The lessons are very interactive and completely immerse you in Greek. You can repeat things as much as you want before moving on and the extra resources of the audio for when you're away from your computer and the mobile companion are fabulous extra practice. I just completed unit 1 and signed up for what they call a studio session, which is where you get to practice what you've been learning live with a real Greek person. I was really nervous but it was great. Now, I think the product is great, but you do have to be motivated. I'm a teacher and I know that my students don't always put in the time so they might remember the most current stuff but not the older material. You've got to keep up with it, review, do it every day, take notes, etc. If you do it passively, I'm not sure how much you're going to get out of it because when there's no English, you really have to remember, so do it on a regular basis.
161716013X,5.0,Rosetta Stone continues to shine as the preeminent language training and development tool.  While it is critical that the use be committed and diligent in using the program, the interactive features Rosetta Stone offers are what takes their system to the next level.  It's a far cry from the old Berlitz method (which to be fair didn't have the technology available today). I haven't completed Level 1, but have already ordered the other levels.
1617160156,5.0,This is the best Rosetta stone version yet!  Everything is easy to navigate. It's actually making learning Greek fun. The program was obviously designed for beginners because it assumes you know nothing, which was perfect for us!
1617160156,5.0,My son wants to learn Greek so his grandmother bought the Rosetta Stone Greek for him.  He just started a few days ago.  It will be a long term project.  We will see how much he can do once he returns from Winter break.
1617160156,5.0,This program is VERY challenging but if you are willing to put in consistent effort, it is very rewarding.  No English instructions so there is a little muddling through the exercises at first but I'm very happy with my progress.  I have taken some group Greek lessons and gone through the Pimsler audio tapes and I think this is a much better program.
1617160156,5.0,Great system that I would highly recommend.  The system is easy to use and easy to navigate.  I hope to be fluent shortly.
1617160156,5.0,I love this system. In only a month, I've learned a lot. Its speech recognition  technology and multi sense approach make learning Greek fun. It's a very comprehensive system. So far I've found only one glitch.
1617160156,4.0,I purchased this for my girlfriend who already owned Greek 1 and 2 from the original version 1 product.  She feels this is far superior to the original (level 1 is about equivalent to both level 1 and 2 on the old version).  It installed easily and runs smoothly.  She really likes the online training component as well.  The only cons to it is the expense and the draconian copy protection.  We have not had to move it yet, but I hear it can be a pain to install it on a new machine (requiring a phone call).
1617160156,5.0,I'm an enthusiastic linguaphile with a background in linguistics and language learning. I learned Spanish through classrooms and textbooks, and although I am fluent, I occasionally get this frustrated feeling like I'm missing a piece, like having skipped a page in a novel but not knowing which page. I learned American Sign Language in a totally natural environment, by contrast, and I feel as at home in ASL as I do in English (my first language). This program feels a lot more like my ASL learning experience than my Spanish experience.I got it to learn as much Greek as possible in about six months, before I go to Greece. I just cracked it open a few days ago, and already I am speaking in full sentences. Granted, they are guided sentences, but I have already pieced together quite a few novel sentences using the vocabulary and grammar I have already picked up. I'm impressed, and I know enough about language learning that being impressed by a piece of software is a pretty big statement for me.Initially I thought I would just learn the absolute basics, enough to survive Greece by myself without an interpreter. But I'm only on level 1, unit 1, lesson 3, and I already see that I am going to learn (and retain) a lot more than survival Greek. I haven't peeked ahead at level two yet, but, judging by how much is packed into the first three lessons, I would guess that each level is superior to an entire semester of a college class, at roughly a third of the price.My only wish so far is that it came with a very basic book of grammar and spelling rules. I do think the program is well-designed, providing careful contrast in each phrase/sentence so that you can figure out the rules as you go, which is the most natural way of doing it. But it would be nice to have a book to go to just for the sake of verifying my success at cracking the code. Although it's cheaper than college, it's still pricey, so I would think they could afford to throw in a few simple guides to grammar and phonetics.
1617160199,5.0,I am very pleased with the Rosetta Stone format for language learning. I now believe it is possible for me to learn Hebrew via this program. Prior to this, I didn't think I could learn such a different language, especially as an adult. It is possible !!!! Shalom !
1617160199,3.0,People have been praising these programs for a while now and I can understand why, but I think an exception has to be made for the Hebrew version, and I'll explain.I purchased this back in January of this year to prepare for my up-coming trip to Israel in June.  I did have a very small vocabulary already of some Hebrew words and phrases before I bought this.  In all I would say I knew about 100 words, and short phrases such as asking someone how they are, and I did learn how to tell someone that I did not speak Hebrew and ask if they spoke English.  Very basic, but still maybe more than a lot of people getting this program.So here is what I do not like about it.  I understand the importance of immersion, and there is not a speck of English in these lessons, and that is the problem, because no English also means no written English as well.  When pictures are put up you will hear the Hebrew word for it, and it will also be spelled using the Hebrew Alphabet, which of course means nothing to me, or to you if you don't know Hebrew, you obviously don't know the Alphabet.  It would be nice if they had a phonetic spelling of the words in English (like the Hebrew-English phrase books that I own).  I find this to be a big help, being able to read the word helps me to remember and associate the picture to the word, and also helps with pronouncing it.To be honest, I have gotten more useful Hebrew out of the Pimsleur series of introductory Hebrew.  With that I can already speak complete sentences and have small conversations, and order in restaurants etc, and those I can listen to in the car, or at the gym and they cost much less.  As you can see between Rosetta, Pimsleur, and my phrase books, I have taken learning Hebrew pretty seriously, and have invested a good amount on it.  I won't say that I have not gotten anything out of Rosetta Stone, but it is not as magical as the adds that you may have seen make it out to be, and again, I think this may pertain to languages where the alphabet and the characters are so different from English.The last criticism that I have is the included audio files that you get with it that you can download to iTunes.  I was really excited about that until I played them.  All they have is someone saying the Hebrew words from the lessons on them.  Not even the English word first, then the Hebrew word so that you know what it is.  It is like listening to a Hebrew movie or TV show with your eyes closed.  You have no idea what the word means if you don't already know it.  And if you have heard the word before but are not 100% sure on what it is, there is nothing to remind you, either you know it, or you don't, and that is confusing and frustrating.  I don't know how anyone could find that useful.  After about 15 minutes of listening and realizing this I didn't even bother listening to another, and went right back to my Pimsleur cd's.Everyone learns differently, so what is not helpful for me, may be fine for you, but if you think this type of immersion learning is right for you, then go for it, because if you can learn that way, then I think you'd be rocking Hebrew in no time.
1617160199,5.0,One complaint: I seriously don't usually have problems with installation, but this program was so confusing! It kept saying I needed to update something and I did and then it wouldn't kick it in automatically afterwards...had to do this 3 times before it finally decided to do what it was supposed to do. I also couldn't find the files right away...just weird.But once it was setup and I was rolling with the program...WOW. This is awesome. And it's addictive, which is what you need when you have to immerse yourself in something. With language, you won't get it unless you are just doing it all of the time. And with this program, well, it's been 2 hours and I am reluctantly going to bed now because I have to get up in 6 hours.Also, for the person who complained about the Hebrew and it not having things spelled out so we can sound them out... Ok, maybe I am just good at this, but I am picking up how to read in Hebrew after 2 hours. I mean, you start to notice patterns in letters and sounds. Just pay attention to the Hebrew spellings when you hear the sounds. Plus, the program DOES teach you to read after a while.Overall, this program is wonderful and I am really excited! I believe if I stick with this, I WILL learn Hebrew.
1617160199,5.0,I am more skeptical than the day is long and believe little of what I read.  I had few choices for Hebrew and gave RS a spin.  I was stunned at its effectiveness!  I have a knack for language but felt out of my comfort zone with an Arabic base.  I just did it and after the first in-person tutoring session, opted for the complete package.  I dutifully take an on-line lesson each week - but it is still a bit uncomfortable.  Regardless, I am a satisfied customer and have used Babbel and Duolingo.  Rosetta is bettah.
1617160199,5.0,i complete my first session in a hour and scored a 88/100 on my test , i love it just a hour a day
1617160199,5.0,Rosetta Stone is the easiest way to learn a language at home.  I've learned several languages, but home study programs never really worked for me.  This one is an exception.  It really helps one to start thinking in the native language.  I highly recommend this program.
1617160199,5.0,Wife finds the program good and enjoys seeing how well she is doing. She finds the words clear and having the grafts help her to understand.
1617160199,5.0,The Product is amazing. the only problem is it didnt go over the basics like alphabet and number first. I am amazed at how much i have learned still via this product. Only bad part is my computer crashed and i now own a Mac.. lol
1617160199,5.0,Still learning,But I feel this program will have me speaking Hebrew in no time at all. Wish I had someone to practice with.....
1617160199,5.0,The Rosetta Stone Hebrew Level 1 is a beneficial software program for those who are studying in the ministerial field. This step-by-step tool provides the necessary tips for absorbing a new language and is a fantastic learning tool. I will consider learning other languages with this program.
1617160253,3.0,I just spent about two hours with this software and have to say, I'm pretty impressed.  In a short time, I've learned male and female, child and adult, one vs. many, conjugation for the previous applied to reading, writing, eating, drinking, cooking, running, swimming.  It also starts giving you Devanagari script basics.  I was able to easily notice the difference between single and plural characters.I considered a class but it was more expensive and this allows me to go at my own pace and repeat sections as much as I want.I'm learning Hindi for recreational purposes but I definitely recommend this.
1617160253,1.0,waste of money. The software dosen't have a good ground up approach, no alphabet exercises. This software would help maybe if you are looking for more conversation practice, but it's still not work the price of it.bottom line, software is out of date and way over priced
1617160253,3.0,I don't find Rosetta Stone as helpful as other language programs. For this Hindi version in particular, I felt that more time should have been spent on actual Hindi words, versus the use of English words in an Indian accent... If 't-shirt' is pronounced 't-shirt' by most Hindi speakers, then I probably don't need to spend so much time on it in the lesson.
1617160253,5.0,Amazon isn't very clear which version this is, exactly. I believe it's the Total-e version, but I'm not sure by how it's worded on this site today (6/28/11).I purchased my copy in August 2010, so I think it may be the previous version. I do not have Total-e.With all that said, I would like to review the software I do have, which I can confirm does match very closely with the description of the software on this page.It is, in a word, EXCELLENT. There are some things about it that are hard to understand, but I honestly don't know how a software program for learning this difficult language could be any better than what Rosetta Stone's (RS) produced.The previous reviewer was complaining that this software is inadequate, because you don't know how to read the script. That is true initially, but leads me to believe that he didn't go very far in the software, because they DO start to teach you to read devanagari within the first unit of level one. It is a fair criticism from the previous reviewer that the foundation they offer is different from what you'd expect. I'm accustomed to learning tourism-friendly phrases first, like to ask where the train station is, etc. RS is NOT like that at all.I knew only the words for some food dishes and for water in Hindi before I started this software, and I could not read a single character in the devanagari syllabary. I was starting from nothing. I have used the Spanish software from RS, and agree that it is to an English speakers definite advantage that Spanish uses the same alphabet we use. However, it is MUCH more complicated to craft a language learning software program in a totally different script. Now that I've spent several months off and on with the program, I appreciate their approach. It would be way too overwhelming to try to learn devanagari first, and then start speaking. 99% of people would quit, because the syllabary is so large and so different from our alphabet.Here is what RS does: They show you pictures, and you hear native speakers talking. You can't read what it says, so you must listen closely. The first unit of level one was tough, I'm not gonna lie. I had to do it a couple of times before I got the hang of it. Then, I just took off. I spent probably 3 or 4 hours with the software on the first day, and by the end of that day, I was able to say "the girl is eating rice". Awesome! I think being able to form a simple sentence so quickly helped keep me engaged and confident, which = motivated.True, it does seem to start you off speaking phrases that are not what you commonly find in language learning resources. I'm only a little more than halfway through level one (because I've been going sporadically, have been redoing sections, etc), and I still haven't learned how to say goodbye or thank you. However, I can ask what something is, describe activities that people are doing, say that "the woman is reading her newspaper," "the man is wearing his coat," "one black cat is under the table," and other such phrases that took me MUCH longer to learn using other language learning techniques. I studied Spanish for two years in high school, and never learned how to say these kinds of sentences.They introduce the characters of the devanagari syllabary slowly. I probably know about 20-25 of them by now. As I mentioned earlier, I'm glad they're going slowly, or else I would get frustrated and bored.The real beauty of RS is that you quickly get to the point where the words just roll off your tongue, unlike when you study a language in a classroom setting and get good at taking tests, but end up tongue tied, because you haven't learned how to have a conversation. RS's emphasis on what they call "dynamic immersion" is so right on the mark. I cannot say enough good things about their approach to language learning.The software is expensive. But guess what? So are classes, and so is going to another country for an immersion at a language school. If you total up the cost of taking language classes at a community college or going to Mexico or Guatemala to study Spanish (for example), this is BY FAR the best value for your money. Why? Because you can return to it at any time. You can practice in the middle of the night, if you want. If you're shy about making mistakes (like me), it doesn't matter, because you're talking to a computer, and you can always redo a lesson for a better score!If you get this software, one tip I have is to ask for help from a native speaker, if you know anyone. If not, then use their Total-e options. I've needed to ask my boyfriend a few questions, and I'm lucky I have him around as a resource, so I didn't need to get or use Total-e.
1617160253,2.0,We are studying Hindi with the Pimsleur method. Because Pimsleur does not use writing in the earlier lessons, (that is a good decision for languages that use our alphabet because we need to learn the sounds and not pronounce the letters as they are in our language.) But, Hindi used a completely different set of characters that are very important to the speaker. So, we learn the pronunciation and sounds, and Rosetta Stone for the other needed parts.We have also used Pimsleur for German and Russian and there have no need for Rosetta Stone.We were using this program to work with the script. It was version 4, which Rosetta Stone says can be put on two computers for five students in a family. That is not true. Because of my eyesight I needed to use a larger screen so I tried to put it on a second computer. It would not activate. I had to delete it from the laptop it was on before I could change it.When I deleted it from the laptop it gave me a set of two numbers, one was the Activation Key, which I already had, and another was the delete number. You had to send both Rosetta Stone before you could activate the program on the exchange computer. Due to a glitch, (in the computer world - one that I have been in since 1979 - glitches happen) and I lost the delete number. I tried to contact Rosetta Stone and work things out so that I could use the program on my larger screen.EDIT: The product now works on both computers. They must have straightened it out in house, but they did not communicate this with me, so I found out by accident. Rosetta Stone is a viable help to Pimsleur since it does have pictures with the words and helps one to visualize certain things. They also help with the Hindi phonetic system and, since that is so different than the Western Alphabet, the help is appreciated. The product is fine, a bit overpriced, but a viable addition to Pimsleur for Hindi. I would not need it for something like German. I can give it two stars now. I would give it three but for the lack of communication with their customers.
1617160318,4.0,As English as my first language this is good for learning most languages like Italian, Irish, Spanish ect.. as I learned much of the Irish rather quickly. But it's not good for learning languages like Korean, Chinese or any Asian language requiring an understanding of the different symbols for the alphabet. Rosetta stone doesn't come with any books to help with grammar or helping to understand how a sentence is put together of any kind, it's learning system is based as a child would learn by listening and pictures only. Like I said it does work well with most languages though.
1617160318,5.0,I have only just begun this lesson but I began to pick it up right away.  The second lesson becomes slightly harder but I am ready to dive in.  There is no English in this so you have to guess what the picture is really &#34;saying&#34; to you.  A slight knowledge of sentence structure and grammar is a must.  Otherwise you will miss the small differences like in he, she or they.  I am really enjoying it so far and like that the software allows me to pronounce the words (even though I am no good at it yet) and gives me a visual cue of the words as I say them.  I think this will be an easy way to pick up enough to have a short conversation.  I am pleased with this product so far.  The only down side is that I do not have internet at my home (I live in the country) and that limits the usage of the product.  Also that made me have to call to get my product activated and from the sounds of it they outsource their customer service to other countries.  This made it slightly difficult to understand the gentleman who was helping me on the phone.  We were able to get the product activated after many repeated misunderstandings.  I have read that others have had problems with the customer service (being rude and unhelpful), I did not experience that (as the man was nice) but very hard to understand.
1617160318,4.0,I am of second generation Irish ancestory and remember the grand stories my grandparents and great-grandparents told about Ireland when they lived there.  I have visited Ireland numerous times and felt I would have a better connection with my ancestory by learning the language.  I am struggling with some of the pronounciations; but am enjoying the learning. I am hoping when I visit Ireland, I would be capable of carrying on a basic conversation with the people.
1617160377,5.0,I wished I used this method to learn Italian.  Previously, I learned from a few sources, which included an audio CD and several "Instant Italian" pocket guides.  Having tried the Rosetta Stone method, I cannot go back to the other ways.  It works.The Rosetta Stone method breaks down and simplifies language learning more intuitively than other programs and methods I've tried.  It does not emphasize grammar rules or vocabulary lists.  Rather, it provides an environment where you learn by associating words with images.  This curriculum follows some of the basic principles in many immersion education programs, and mimics the way language is taught to a small child.  In my opinion and experience, this association method helps to increase retention, and makes learning much more intuitive.This package has a very good speech recognition system integrated into the program.  This helps to improve the learning process, since it gives feedback on accent and pronunciation, and improves your ability to speak as well.What I liked:Interactive software - I was able to apply what I learned after each lesson.It also comes with a headset+microphone to help with the pronounciation.  BIG PLUS!Audio companion - I loaded up these lessons on my MPT3 player and I was able to practice while driving to and from work.Online Lessons - I liked the practice sessions, and having native Italian speakers is a huge plus.I was able to perfect my pronunciation with this set.  There is an online community that you can join and participate with others online.  It's a very nice addition, and something that seems exclusive to Rosetta.  However, this feature is only available without extra cost for 3 months, after this trial period it is $25/month, or $149 for 15 months.  I finished the software lessons, went through it again, and then used the online feature.What I didn't like:My only issue is the price.  It is very expensive!  In some sense, you get what you pay for, and with this you pay a premium.  However, if you want to learn Italian on your own time, and you can afford it, I highly recommend the Rosetta Stone.
1617160377,4.0,This is a typical Rosetta Stone product:  good quality teaching, good materials.  However, it is a better value to buy the entire Rosetta Stone set (levels 1-4) if you are at all interested in learning Italian.
1617160377,5.0,If you really need to learn a new language, and learn it fast, Rosetta Stone is the way. I've taken college/high school and even junior high classes and learned. I took a Berlitz course and learned. But by far, the fastest way to a new language - and outside of taking one as a kid in public school - the cheapest way, too, is Rosetta Stone.No, I don't work for them or even get to date that spokeswoman in the tight blue dress. But I do love learning languages and I really like RS. Lots of options to learn so you won't get bored. Very little of the repeat-after-me stuff from normal classes. And actual fun lessons. Plus iphone apps and internet based learning. They have the bases covered.Ok, what I don't like - the complexity of the install with all the verifications and such. I understand the need to prevent software theft. It seems like, as usual, the legitimate purchasers end up paying the price ($ and install-wise) for the people that don't. Arg! I'm not sure how easy/hard it would be to install it on two machines or even how hard a reinstall would be should you need to move to a new computer, but I dread finding out!That little caveat aside - and it only pertains to installing the one time - this is a TERRIFIC product. It ain't cheap, but real learning seldom is. And the benefits to you are huge.
1617160377,5.0,Rosette excelleant. Had to return as I began too late. Intend to purchase another Rosetta. I am sold on this product.
1617160377,5.0,Blown away by this program!!! My son left for a missions trip to Italy three months ago, and this was his "hobby" before he left! He would come to me daily trying out his Italian on me and he sounded very good!I've gone through a lot of the program. It's laid out quite nicely and easy to follow. I love that the use of photos is used so much in this program, because both my son and I are visual learners. But if you're an audio learner, there's plenty of that too!!Anyway, love these Rosetta Stone programs. We completed Spanish last year and had the same experience with that!! Get this -  you won't be sorry!
1617160377,5.0,I have always wanted to learn Italian and this program is the first step. I don't think I will ever put myself in a position where I have to talk about a man and a boy drinking water though, because it is a mouthful!
1617160377,4.0,Never having studied Italian before, and never having used Rosetta Stone before, I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months, spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end, I think it was a smart system, one that has specific advantages, but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES:+++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English.  you will only see pictures and hear Italian.  This means you'll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a "male", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said "PO" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the "putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.
1617160377,5.0,Although I haven't kept up with the lessons as I should have, I have learned a lot of Italian with only the first level. I spoke some dialect, but have conjugation issues! This is most assuredly the best program I've used to learn Italian. I have the older version too, and I like the new audio-visual matching; it's different from the older version and moves a lot faster.With this version, you can move at your own pace a lot easier, and see your mistakes sooner, which is helpful.Not only does this have visual learning, and learning by audio, but also by speaking, and comparing your pronunciation to that of a native speaker, which I think is the most helpful part of the software. The way the teaching of the language is set up, is I believe, the closest to learning it naturally with native speakers. I highly recommend this software...grazie!
1617160377,1.0,This teaching tool left a lot to be desired for me.  For the price, it should have included a book of words and phrases to assist in learning process. It was too structured to be of any assistance in what I felt I needed.  In my plans to visist Italy, I needed to learn words that would assist me in traveling, shopping, going into eating establishments, and simple needs.I was so excited to receive the Rosetta Stone package and get started on the process, but was so disappointed in the program.  I did not want to do group sessions or learn to spell and write Italian. I wasn't moving there.  I just needed to learn as many useable words as I could for my trip.
1617160377,4.0,As a homeschooling mother who discusses with other home educating parents how to teach certain subjects, foreign language is one of the trickier topics to deal with; Rosetta Stone (RS) has been at the top of the list of foreign language instruction software since for so long it and it has been known as being the best software option on the market.Homeschooling parents typically have three options for teaching foreign language: 1) if they are a fluent speaker they can teach it directly, often using a textbook curriculum for the structure; 2) use computer software like RS for child-led learning; or 3) take an online class supported by a teacher.A major downside is RS lacks a strong grammar component; its strength is getting a person to have oral fluency. I am hearing stories from other homeschoolers who have used RS for multiple years and who were happy with RS, that they are too lacking in grammar to perform well on the SAT II test (the SAT subject test is now required by some colleges for admission), so they are suddenly unhappy with RS but it's too late to do anything about it. I want to learn from those people's mistakes! If you desire a stronger grammar component, before buying RS you should look into a newer productFluenz Italian 1 with supplemental Audio CD and Podcastswhich seems just like RS but with more grammar (and is similarly priced).Also if you are a homeschooling parent you should know there is a "RSFluenz Italian 1+2 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcastshomeschool package" (see the RS website for info), which may be better than this `standard' product for your homeschool.--RS was easy to install, we had no problem getting it started on our Windows PC. There was some confusion over activating the online account, which is free for 90 days only, which we wound up not using anyway, as the base lessons were enough. We misunderstood the directions and thought we HAD to register online to start using it, but that doesn't seem to be correct.To test RS I used it, as did both of my homeschooled kids (aged 10 and 13). The only system glitch we have sometimes was the headset would not activate sometimes, when switching between users who attempt to use RS right after someone else used it. The fix that works is rebooting the PC.The program prompts the user to speak into the headset and it checks the accuracy. One of my kids (a newbie to learning foreign language) seems to have a problem and he blames the headset or the program for hearing him wrong but in RS's defense when I listen to the sample and then what my son is saying I detect a minor intonation error on my son's part or the emphasis part of the word is not being emphasized strongly enough, so the problem is my SON not the system. My other son has this problem once in a while only. I have not experienced this myself as after years of taking French in public school and college I have trained my ear to listen very carefully and also keep telling myself to not use Standard English speaking patterns (my son keeps overriding the Italian and inserting a more English language sound). I keep emphasizing to my sons to watch the voice recognition graph so they can see where there is a problem (it's a pretty cool feature). I mention this as perhaps other users may have this issue and might think the voice recognition software is faulty when really it is the user!This product is marketed to adults not just children. As an adult learner who formerly learned in a very different way this RS method of learning felt odd to me. I wanted to see things written out that I could look at (I'm a strong visual-text learner). Don't laugh but it took me a while to figure out what I was saying, not realizing for example that in Italian there is a pronoun for multiple females as "they". It was a bit odd to jump right in learning multiple pronouns that we don't use in English and also to use the verb conjugations without seeing anything in writing to explain it. I was having memory flashbacks of my school's French textbook that had the nice list of conjugations so I could read it written out while I was reciting it orally to help cement it in my mind. This way of learning the pronoun and verb when looking at just a color photo of the scene being referenced is so different for me, however it appeals to people who have a stronger sense of visual-image learning or for auditory learners. I still feel I need some kind of rule list to see in front of me, I found it hard to both learn the content and think to try to figure out the rules myself right in the middle of the lessons. For example, there is no direct teaching of which noun is feminine versus masculine and how that affects both the ending of the noun and the choice of verb to use with it. I had to figure out that `a' at the end is typically feminine and that `o' is typically masculine. I only knew about the existence of gender differences for non-living things from my former French classes; to my English speaking kids this is all new and is being taught without a basic, direct explanation. The RS method goes all the way back to how babies and toddlers learn to speak a native language and teaches it that way. (I think I will look for a supplemental book to supply this information.)My kids are flying through the lessons and really love it. To them it doesn't feel like work, they find it fun. As the program goes on there is more of a written component using the keyboard to type in material.The system is easy to use and I like the way it keeps a score and how you can't progress past certain points without getting a certain high score. It is easy to navigate through the menu in order to re-do selected lessons.We have been using Rosetta Stone Italian I for about two months and enjoy it. As a homeschooling family, if we were to purchase Rosetta Stone new I'd purchase the homeschool package not the standard package. I also would seriously consider usingFluenz Italian 1 with supplemental Audio CD and Podcastsinstead of Rosetta Stone for a stronger grammar element, but I've not been able to see Fluenz in real life yet (there are online video samples to view on Amazon.com though).  I'm sorry that I can't do a comparison between the two.
1617160377,5.0,So reads a lofty promise on the box of Rosetta Stone's Level 1 "Italiano" course. "Do those things actually work?" is the question most people ask us when they hear we have one. You know, they actually do. From my dyslexic sister to my stroke-victim mother, Rosetta Stone meets the challenges of teaching a wide range of people and at a wide range of natural ability.My personal failure to learn a foreign language is legendary. I took years of both high school and college Spanish--can't speak it. I got all the way to intermediate American Sign Language with college courses--can't get past spelling my name. I have failed at Korean, German, and French with equal aplomb. So as someone who has used tapes, CDs, computer programs, traditional school-room methods and real live people willing to teach me, let me say with some authority that Rosetta Stone is not only the best language learning device I have ever seen it is the only way I would ever recommend learning a foreign language outside of parachuting into a foreign country and stumbling around until you figure out what people are trying to tell you (otherwise known as "total immersion"). The lessons are challenging without being frustrating, the method is entertaining on a certain level, and the results immediate and noticeable.I like learning and I liked school, so I didn't mind working my way through the program. The real surprise was my little sister. She is severely dyslexic and absolutely hated most of her school life. She took to this like I couldn't believe, coming over to my house just for her "lessons" and sitting for hours quietly working through the program. She's rarely shown such devotion to learning and certainly not on her own free time. I also plan to set up an account for my mother, who had a series of strokes a few years back and is on disability. She could never learn a language in a classroom or by a rote memorization method (she can't remember what she did an hour ago) but she could learn this. I have never come across a learning program that works in the face of so many different kinds of obstacles.Weak spots are minor and few. The microphone included with the set doesn't always pick up voice correctly (for the amount they charge they should use a top-quality mike). The "games" in the program are tedious and have a thrown-together-at-the-last-moment-feel. I did not use the online functions because I really really detest the current trend of nickel and diming people to death with "subscriptions" for every little thing. If you shell out hundreds of dollars you should get all you need and you should own it clear and outright. But if you don't mind paying for a subscription when your free two months runs out this would not be a demerit. I wanted to review the program without the online functions for those that would not/could not use them, and I think the set is perfectly adequate as is.For homeschooled kids, children with learning disabilities, baby-boomers looking to keep their minds sharp, those planning an extended vacation, of if you just want to converse with the cute Italian guy at who works at the grocery store, Rosetta Stone is worth the money. Set up is easy and you're off and running in under ten minutes. Side effects include cravings for pasta and a desire to plan a trip to Lake Como.  I wonder if George Clooney has one of these?GRADE: A, or 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 for Amazon purposes.
1617160377,1.0,Got this software for Christmas, after a month of emailing back and forth they finally told me it is not compatible with some CD drives and that I must make a copy of it on a separate computer to a thumb drive to install it. For $180 bucks you would expect better customer service and a well-vetted install.. or maybe some online install. If you have a mac, be prepared for a headahce.
1617160377,5.0,I've always found learning a new language to be a huge challenge. Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language (and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new language. If you're serious about becoming fluent in Italian or looking for more than just the ability to "try on" a new language, then you'll want to get the advanced versions (unfortunately, at a much higher cost).It is a very fun way to learn a language. If you're willing to put in the time, it does produce results.
1617160377,4.0,Overall I've always wanted to learn Italian and tried using the Pimsleur format series (which are recorded lessons), which is very good but as it doesn't give you active feedback you aren't sure where you stand.  In particular this is the case with pronunciation, as it's difficult to ensure you're saying things properly.  The Rosetta stone format helps immensely with this is as it provides active feedback with its microphone and headset.  I found this an important aspect because it keeps me motivated to continue practicing day in and out AND I'm ensured my practicing is proper.  Without active feedback, it's like learning to play a musical instrument without having anyone listen to you play - you may THINK you're playing well but really, you aren't, so the first time you try to perform, you'll get a lot of strange looks.  No different here.Downsides?  Need some fairly decent computing power to get this running.  I wouldn't touch it on anything less than a modern dual core.The level 1 is far too basic for anyone to just stop there.  One needs to continue onwards to at least level 5 to gain any noticeable appreciation in skills.  I know most will shy away from the higher levels because they cost so much.  It's hard for most people to push the button for a $400 software package these days.  Then again, you need to compare to getting professional lessons which will definitely cost you more.  Overall, like anything else, you need to be serious that you want to learn.
1617160377,1.0,i have found it to be extremely repetitive and is not helpful in learning basic conversational italian. i would differently not recommend it.
1617160377,5.0,I was thrilled to get the Rosetta Stone and be able to begin a lifelong desire to speak Italian!The software was very easy to load and use. The simple approach to learning a language as a child does was one terrific idea!I agree with other posters that to become fluent you will need to purchase more than just this level 1 program. However, this does allow you to learn some simple things and I do feel you could communicate enough to get your idea across.And, it is FUN to do! I'm enjoying it immensely!
1617160377,5.0,I love Rosetta Stone it is easy to use in a few quick lessons you are speaking Italian. I like how the lessons are short and easy to finish.i like the pictures I can't wait to go to Italy.
1617160377,5.0,Install Machine:Intel iMac 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4 GB DDR3 RAM, OS 10.6.6Install was smooth and easy.  No hangups.  It immediately asked if I wanted to update after I installed.  It was about a 4 MB update and downloaded/installed quickly.  Need admin privileges to install software.  Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy.  The only issue I had was getting the included microphone/headset to work right.  It kept telling me to say "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" into the microphone, but it kept saying it couldn't configure the microphone.  I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine.  In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be done.  I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for just the microphone?  Oh well, no big deal, just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son, and he enjoyed it a great deal too.  He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English.  It was only images and Italian words and speaking.  This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words.  However, it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is high.  However, how much would it cost to take a foreign language class?  The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost.  So given the high price, I still think this is a good buy if you are a good solo learner.  Great for those who don't have time to take an instructor lead course.
1617160377,5.0,To place my review in proper perspective, I first want to mention two considerations. I am not new to the Italian language, and obtained the product as a refresher, so I cannot say whether the 'total immersion' method would be effective for myself or universally. Second, I am a Vine reviewer, and had intended to order levels 1-5, but the last copy was gone by the time I'd selected my mailing address. Level 1 is much too elementary, even as a 'brush up', for one with previous knowledge of Italian.Nonetheless, I believe anyone using Rosetta Stone should find it to be stimulating and fun, as well as informative. The various exercises, capacity for interaction, and games transform what could be tedious into what I'm sure many will find a constant treat.Allowing for that the vocabulary at this level is not new to me, I must say that, since my memory is more visual than audio, and I find studying vocabulary in books to be helpful, I cannot say whether I could have picked up much had I depended only on this method. I would imagine that others might find this method to be helpful, but might need to supplement their studies.
1617160377,5.0,Rosetta Stone Italian level (I) was just what I expected from reading the details in the ads. Progressing nicely with my first attempt at Italian.
1617160377,5.0,I had reviewed a couple years back Rosetta Stone's V3 software.  Little has changed at the core of the learning system, which is by far and away a good thing.  If you're not familiar with how this program works, it is truly the most "natural" way to learn a language.Let me explain (if you do know how this works skip to the next paragraph for updates on the new features).  This program does the best it can to mimic a child-like learning environment, which is what everyone needs to learn.  I really mean it.  Think of it this way: how do children learn a language?  They imitate what they hear and see, right?  They do not have a concept early on of memorization.  Children do not memorize language, grammar, vocabulary, sentences, etc...they repeat what they hear, associate what they hear with what they see, and make mistakes as they go, slowly correcting themselves with guidance and observation and trial and error.  This program does the same thing, but with you, an adult (or so I presume for most readers of this review).  It shows you a picture, associates the word visually, and then through audition.  You then practice back by seeing, choosing, saying the words that you have learned.  You'll make mistakes, but will self-correct with this program just like a child would.  Practice will not make perfect, only permanent.  Hence, when you do practice, make sure to do it slowly and really understand what it is that you're saying, seeing, and hearing; this program makes it much easier than reading a book alone, or just listening to audio cassettes; it's truly an all-encompassing programs.  Memorization and just repetition is NOT the way to learn a language, and friend of mine who did this for 4 years (think Highschool) cannot speak a single sentence even though they were A students.  I, having been blessed with a teacher who forced us to live the language by all the ways that a mind can comprehend it, never memorized the language, and can speak it very well now (no medical terms, but good `ol conversation and banter).So, what's new here compared to V3?  I was pleasantly surprised that at least one of my previous suggestions in a previous review was taken seriously.  I had mentioned the need for you to practice with native speakers in order to really get the hang of a language.  And now, you get this chance with a short free trial.  I had also mentioned in the old review to make learning the language fun, as anything that's fun is instantly remembered for the long term better as we all know.  Rosetta Stone included games to play and enjoy.  I'm very happy that this company really listens to its customers and updates its products, instead of sticking to its guns thinking they figured everything out.  Two thumbs up for that.I HAVE NOT (reason forthcoming), yet tried the online sessions with the native speakers.  There's a reason for this, and I really hope you take note of this before purchasing this product.  First, I don't recommend purchasing level 1 of this language (and logically of any).  I want you to ask yourself why you want to learn this language?  To learn how to say "pants" and barely speak or comprehend a sentence, or to actually learn to have some minimal conversational skill?  I'm going to take a wild guess and say you fit into the latter category.  It makes no sense to me to "try" out learning a language and barely learn anything for such an EXPENSIVE program!  Unless you have money to burn skip buying the incomplete set, please.  I recommend that if you are REALLY truly serious about getting the hang of a language to a minimally conversational degree with just the software then get the entire set and save yourself money in the long-run (quite a bit I might add).  Then use the online native speakers to help you master your conversational abilities.  BUT, I emphasize, DO NOT waste your money activating your free trial of the native speaker engagement sessions (and games) until you have complete the entire program.  Why in the world would you take precious time and money to do such a thing when you'll just be able to spit back the names of colors and buildings back to one another?  Wait until you get semi-coherent and put your hard earned dollars to work only then, after mastering the program.  This is precisely why I haven't activated the free trial yet, I want to really get the hang of at least the portion of the program I got to review until I speak to a native speaker.
1617160377,5.0,It's expensive, but compare it to college tuition and it turns out to be a bargain. It isn't a quick fix learning program for a tourist. It is a slow process, but rewarding as you go along so you will want to learn more. Grammar rules are introduced very slowly so you learn them well and vocabulary is limited for those who desire to learn Italian fluently. This software does however provide you with a solid foundation that will allow you to use proper grammar and create proper sentence structure. Don't expect to know how to say "caterpillar" or "kaleidoscope" because if you do then you are expecting the impossible. If you finish the software and buy a vocabulary book, you will be in good shape. My best advice is to go on the rosetta stone website and try the interactive demo. It is the first few lessons of the first level. Everybody learns differently, so I can tell you that if the program works great for 20 minutes, it will continue to work for another 20 thousand. I actually received a trial CD in the mail a couple years ago and that was what inspired me to buy the full version. I was that impressed. Within five minutes, I learned (and retained) more than I ever learned in the past with audio CDs and traditional classes. Give it a shot and let me know if you agree too.
1617160377,4.0,Rosetta Stone Italiano Level 1Rosetta Stone Italiano Level 1 is easy to install and use. The included instructions are simple and straightforward. Activation required 2 tries, but it appears the code is only valid for 3 months so I suspect online access may be terminated after 3 months but the software should still continue to work.The pace starts off slow, but within the early portion of Unit 1, the vocabulary starts to pick up rather quickly. Since I am not a language expert, I had a hard time keeping up initially because different tenses of words, or the plural, were thrown in. Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out, which is quite useful but I could not get a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech. Once you start getting used to the phrases, the software begins to kick it up by throwing in more words. Unfortunately, like other users, the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition. This helps with pronunciation, although I found that it will disable my main audio and I have to switch back and forth. This isn't a big deal for most people, and there's no easy workaround.The box advertises that many Government agencies use Rosetta Stone, like the US Army and State Department. There certainly is value in the Rosetta Stone software helping Soldiers or agents learn a foreign language in the shortest time possible, but I felt it should focus on more useful phrases. 45 minutes of repeating various forms of "Boys eating", or "girls running" are not phrases that have much tactical value when you're visiting or operating in a different country.Overall: 4/5 stars
1617160377,1.0,How does any foreign language CD teach its language by merely repeating its words without translating those words into English?  Now I can pronounce those words but I have no idea what I am saying!  What a concept and I am out over $100.00!
1617160377,1.0,Do not buy this product from Amazon. Once opened, you are stuck with it. I have tried for several days to install this product on two different computers all with the tech support of Rosetta Stone. We cannot get it to install correctly. I have no idea how good the product is. I can say tech support seems to have done everything they could. They have even sent replacement disks. If I had bought it directly from Rosetta Stone, I would and could return it, but from Amazon, I cannot.
1617160377,5.0,I was prepared to be disappointed with Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1, the first Rosetta Stone I've tried.  It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program.  The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written.  Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases.  Total immersion, everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer.  Everything is accompanied by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways:  you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy running, boys running).  In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for "talking to myself". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD.  The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone.  Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late.  If you're in the Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone. I only checked the price for Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 and as of writing this review, the price is the same as the price on amazon.I am using this program on a PC XP with no problems.
1617160377,5.0,I actually have used the Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 1 & 2 and found it great in terms of learning the language. At first, the Rosetta Stone method seems harder because you associate pictures with words and phrases but their whole premise is that is how you first learned a language by seeing something and then associating the word with that object or action. It is way better than pure memorization! I have gone through several lessons and I am picking it up rather quickly as I have a background in Spanish. Overall a great way to learn a new language!
1617160377,5.0,I gave this to my daughter last Xmas as she is going to Italy next summer. She is enjoying it.
1617160377,3.0,It has a weakness. It used the technique of showing a few pictures on a screen and a phrase and asks you to match the phrase to the correct picture. For example you will have four pictures of people eating food, a boy, a girl, a man and a woman.The phrase will be something in Italian like ' the boy is eating'. If you are new to Italian you won't know which of the Italian words are for the English words.
1617160377,4.0,I've been using this for a few weeks. Previously, my Italian was limited to stuff I'd see on "The Godfather" and a few foods. I'm a bit better now, and eager to see what the further levels of Rosetta Stone look like. Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning like living there, but it's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- Doesn't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn't contain a whole lot- It's obviously pretty expensive. I guess if you're *really* interested, it's worth it.For it's purpose, it is almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this.
1617160377,5.0,I purchased this software for my fiancee for her birthday. We installed the software on a Mac, OS X Leopard(10.5.x). Works great. Its does have a problem with microphones other than the one that comes with the software. It does not recognize the voice from other microphones. I recommend this for couples who will travel to Italy.
1617160377,4.0,I would like it when they added more words to make a sentence, they translated it and told us what we were saying in english. More translation in the program would be good and more explanation to the connecting words. For example: La, Le, delle, lui, li and so on.
1617160377,4.0,Rosetta Stone delivers on teaching language quickly and naturally.  The new version is even easier and more fun to use than prior versions with a selection of different games serving to reinforce learning in novel ways.  The pictures employed are a few steps above prior versions, lending an elegant gloss to the proceedings.  Special characters are handled intuitively when writing via keyboard characters or mouse click.One downside to Rosetta Stone's approach is that grammar and spelling are a bit tougher to get.  There may be no substitute to old school drills and repetition here.The only thing preventing a five star review is that Rosetta Stone actually puts its security cards--needed to unlock higher lessons---in the flap of the software box.  Having used prior versions of the software I'd thrown this flap out.  That can be a very expensive problem to fix!I would hope that Rosetta Stone decides to change the packaging so that all required components are in the inner box where one would expect them to be.
1617160377,3.0,Rosetta Stone makes a nicely polished language learning program, with one fairly substantial drawback:  you won't really learn a language.Rosetta's claim is that by learning a language as a child learns (i.e., without translating into another language), you'll internalize the language and eventually be able to think in it, instead of translating on the fly.  This may be true, but it takes children years and years to learn their first language (they're still studying grammar all the way through 8th grade!).  By adopting a child's approach to language learning, Rosetta will leave you lacking in a lot of key areas that other language learning approaches can quickly teach you.If you took any language courses in school, you may remember how much time you spent conjugating irregular verbs and declining nouns.  These tasks may seem like a useless chore, since you can spend months studying and still feel no closer to fluency.  Nevertheless, a good grasp of grammar lays an excellent foundation for language proficiency later.  Children don't learn this way, since there is no simple clip art that can be presented to them to explain the concept of the future plu-perfect conjugation, or the subjunctive mood.  As an adult with (hopefully) a strong grasp on your language of birth, these advanced concepts can be explained to you early on in your study of a second language, so you don't have to spend years and years down the road trying to build a foundation of grammar and syntax underneath a ramshackle house of vocabulary.Rosetta's approach of teaching some elementary vocabulary (boy, girl, runs, walks) and simple relationship words (over, under, next to, etc.) can quickly give you the power to communicate simple concepts in a new language -- which undeniably can be more useful early on than the ability to conjugate the verb "to be" in every person, number, mood and tense.  Their choice of vocabulary words for early emphasis won't be particularly helpful to travelers (other language learning systems may teach you more useful traveling vocab, like "where is the museum" and "what time does the train depart"), but they will give you the ability to communicate simply.Nevertheless, the lack of emphasis on grammar and syntax (again, because there is no translation into English, only pictures of things and actions, with deductive reasoning to pick up the slack), you may find yourself sounding to a native speaker a bit like Tarzan "us will gone statue and picture place" instead of "would you like to go with me to the museum?"For the skills that Rosetta stone is trying to teach, the approach is appropriate, and the implementation is very nicely polished (although some of the flashcard-pictures have a weird, taken-in-the-1970s vibe to them).  The approach itself is not enough to teach you a language, and completely ignores the advantages that an adult with a good grasp on their first language can bring to learning a second language.  I think that Rosetta, in combination with a more traditional approach to second-language learning, could be a very powerful combination to help you rapidly internalize vocabulary (with Rosetta), and to lay a good foundation of grammar and syntax.
1617160377,5.0,Just beginning w/the the beginning Italian.  Reminds me of my first grade reading primers...sight & words/sight & words continuously...no English...just the written words(s) repeated vocally, and in turn, you have to repeat it.  Great learning tool!
1617160377,3.0,It's okay is the perfect description.  For us it is difficult to navigate, limited online accessibility and not really what we expected.  I wish the accompanying MP3 adaptable CD also would play in my vehicle during drive time.Not what we would term totally user friendly.
1617160377,4.0,I have to admit, I was more impressed by Rosetta Stone than I thought I'd be. I learned French the old fashioned way (four years in high school and more in college), so the idea of taking on a new language in a way I had never tried before seemed like an interesting alternative.It was a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be. I have a smattering of Italian from my family, and this added to it when I began to recognize words I had never seen before, but only heard.It installed on my Mac with no problems. I had a few issues with the microphone, but if you google it (there is help online), I found a fix that worked with little effort.I can't say Level 1 of Rosetta Stone is going to make you speak like a native, but after sampling this, it really does make you want to go onto the next phase, if it's as painless as this was.
1617160377,5.0,At the age of 57, I decided to learn Italian. The last time I tried to learn a new language was in high school. I was dubious that any program could motivate this old brain to memorize a language without going into a vegetative state.  As it turns out, Rosetta Stone's program requires little rote memorization. Instead, I found lots of fun and enjoyment in the name of learning.Prior to beginning this program, I never understood how total immersion could be conducive to learning a language. To me total immersion meant total confusion.  While this program is guided immersion, it is not confusing.  Vivid pictures and multiple choice games are entertaining.  It is amusing that the pictures are not just of those who appear European but from a variety of cultures. When learning an Italian word, the picture may be of someone of Asian descent.For each level, there are ways to check yourself and review any content you feel needs review. Using a headset (included), you must pronounce words correctly or you will be given an opportunity to repeat it.  The program even breaks down the word into syllables and a visual (chart) to assist in forming the words correctly.The program is easy to install and allows two people to use it. It remembers where each person left off.A friend or mine loves languages, speaks several and teaches English as a foreign language. She found the program to be excellent in its methods.  In fact, she buys Rosetta Stone to review languages she learned in college to keep it fresh.If I can learn while having fun, anyone can.  Love it! Go for it!
1617160377,4.0,I've had the opportunity to review several Rosetta Stone language software programs and have found them all to be quite good.  They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language.  I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent.  Level One for me, is just right.  However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian.  I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language.  Also, I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes.  I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the program itself.  After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied.  I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language.  Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute.
1617160377,4.0,I wanted a refresher course in Italian so I ordered this Rosetta Stone Italiano - Level 1.  This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run across and even with brief usage, has yielded great results.  Although I have no major complaints with the program itself, the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues with installing the software, I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed.  For example, Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language software to work properly and Vista needs SP2.  It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems.  If you have an older pc, you really need to check the hardware requirements.  Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start booklet, installation cds, software cds, headset, user agreement booklet, keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services.  The quick start guide is important to read first and provides support online or by telephone (called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze).  The software installed easily on Windows 7 as did the included headset via usb port.  The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it. The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic.  I had an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software.  I don't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal.  I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation (the headset has a microphone), builds vocabulary and phrases, and teaches simple conversation.  The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering: basics (unit 1), greetings and introduction (unit 2), work and school (unit 3) and shopping (unit 4).  Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone's online services is required. Although the box states it includes free online features, they are free for three months only.  There is a $25 monthly fee  or a $149 fee for 15 months for online services after the trial period.  The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account.  I strongly suggest you use the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software.  The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors, games, and an online community to practice your Italian.  I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons to get more out of it.  It's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall, this is a great tool to learn Italian if you can afford the hefty price tag.  For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more convenient and provides more personalized service.  Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost.  I don't think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian, this would be worth the price.  I consider having friendly customer service available by phone a big plus.
1617160377,5.0,I can now say that Rosetta Stone makes learning Italian easier and actually enjoyable.I have tried learning foreign languages off and on for several years with disheartening results.  However, this way of learning surpasses everything that I have attempted to do before.  Sure, Rosetta Stone is known for its quality, but this goes further with a new (to me, at least) online feature that allows you to schedule a 50 min. group session with a native speaker.  This provides good practice with a competent conversationalist, taking immersion to another level. Another helpful addition is a series of games that you unlock as you progress through the program.  These games enhance memorization skills.I am glad we made the decision to order this version of Rosetta Stone.
1617160377,5.0,I've used other Rosetta Stone language sets before, and I have become an enthusiastic advocate of the series ever since I first popped the discs into my computer.  This series does a very thorough, professional, and entertaining job of introducing concepts, pronunciation, and culture to the user which makes it fun and intuitive to learn.  One aspect that all users of of this series should think of is the considerable amount of money you will save by taking the Rosetta Stone courses over university-taught courses.  I fully endorse the university experience to everyone, but one part of my education that I didn't appreciate was the way my foreign languages were crow-barred into a tight window dictated by the school's curriculum.  I know that time is a factor in all classroom environments, but in my experience, foreign languages are best taught with more time and patience given to the student.  This set really promotes that idea, and manages to have a great deal of social interactivity as well.This program comes with games, live practice sessions, and practical exercises that were actually kind of fun to participate in. I am surprised at the level of immersion a strictly online application is able to achieve. Before I used this product, I felt a set like this would lack social interaction with other native speakers, and learning pronunciations, backgrounds, and some sort of framework as to why a word is pronounced the way it is. A frustrating aspect of any language course at a university is that you are sped (or slowed) along at whatever pace is dictated to your instructor, thus losing some continuity and flow of the learning process. When one is forced to learn a language in a certain time frame it can either cause a lot of stress for those who don't understand concepts, or bore those who feel like they have a good grasp of the material. This set is very useful because you can learn at your own pace, challenge yourself if you feel up to the task, and never get caught in an annoying time schedule. Taking public language courses can be corrupted by rules and regulations, and this set counteracts that notion. Of course, universities have their own versions of online tests and practices, but none are as colorful and vivid as the ones I've experienced in this set. Rosetta Stone has an online community of users that I checked in on several times, and it was filled each time with people waiting to practice and speak with others. The volume of interaction was huge compared to my university experience which is essential in learning a new language.A great deal of production and attention to detail was put into this Rosetta Stone set, and the level of immersion and exercises is not only high, but very enjoyable and interesting. It might be harder to understand how useful this is without ever having taken a university-taught course in language, but I'm now sold. Frankly, I was a little skeptical of how this would work, because learning a new language ultimately needs to be a social experience, and hearing and witnessing native speakers in action is essential in becoming a skilled speaker. However, this set does a fantastic job of capturing that social interaction, and even manages to be a little more exciting in interacting with others via the internet and phone.This is the second foreign language set I've used, and I'm having a good time learning Italian, at my own pace.  It's important that users make a push to learn and to not take too much time in immersing themselves in the concepts with a foreign language, but it's a huge plus to be able to allow oneself to fully grasp an idea before they move on.  Rosetta Stone allows that window to be more flexible, and ultimately clears the way for better and more effective learning.
1617160377,5.0,This item is a great language program, but you have to make sure your pc has the latest updated software.  You really need to double check the requirements.  This kit includes: installation and software cds, headset, and keyboard stickers.  Rosetta Stone also included games, which always makes learning a little more fun.I don't know Italian yet, but I do have a lot of hope I will soon.
1617160377,5.0,I got Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 a few months prior to a vacation in Rome, mainly because the last time my wife and I visited Italy, we went without knowing any Italian and all... and that made for some frustration.I speak Japanese and some Spanish, so I am familiar with the challenges involved in learning a new language. However, Rosetta Stone made it easy and fun to learn very basic Italian. This allowed me to keep the travel book with frequently used phrases in my pocket when asking questions at shops and for directions, mainly.The main problem was once I asked in Italian the person usually would speak to me in Italian and I had to confess, in Italian, that I only knew a very little Italian. So at least they could understand what I was able to say! Thanks to Rosetta Stone I was comfortable not only listening but also speaking Italian because I had so much practice doing both.I'd give yourself at least 2-3 months before trying this in-country, but the pace in which you learn is really up to you. There are so many options that I didn't use... like the online lessons, the games, the community. I just didn't have the time for those and found the basic tutorials quite sufficient (and excellent) but it's great to have those options.
1617160377,4.0,I really liked this software for learning basic Italian, nothing too fancy for me, and it was fun to use.  I liked the easy to navigate interface and the variety of learning tools included.  For someone who wants to learn a basic level of the Italian language, and can afford this software, this would be a possibility for you.  I recommend.
1617160377,5.0,So far it's been a great experience.  Everything I needed was in the box and I have been having fun learning a new language.
1617160377,4.0,I enjoy the different ways of learning the language.  My only criticism is that there are some sessions where the Italian is never translated, and I don't know what some of the words in the sentence mean, for example:  abbiamo , hanna,
1617160377,5.0,I lived in Italy for 5 years, and learned the basics.  Over time and without useage I have forgotten most of what I knew.  Rosetta Stone re-inforced my memories and with it I have become almost fluent again.  All this in less than 3 weeks.  I wish I had purchased the advanced studies version though.
1617160377,2.0,All seemed to go well until I got to the first lesson. I spent three days trying to get to it. The instructions said to &#34;click on the green arrow&#34;. Simple enough except all it did was bring to the a slew of boxes that gave choices from lessons to games, however clicking on the green arrown DID NOT bring me to lesson number one. All it did was keep sending the same choice boxes with god awful music in the back ground. So, Amazon was good enough to accept its return and refund my money.
1617160377,5.0,very expensive but it is worth it. Sadly this is just one level but it is exactly what my boyfriend wanted, just a beginners guide to talk to me in italian
1617160377,5.0,I bought this for my 64 year old husband for Christmas.  I only bought the first level thinking he can never learnhow to speak Italian!!  Boy was I wrong!  He is doing fabulous.  I am going to have to buy the other levels soon!
1617160377,3.0,I have only had this for a few weeks and it is okay. It is pretty straight forward and easy to use. No new earth shattering way to learn a language. I thought it might have some new technique for learning  but it is repetition with technology. The technology justs makes it more fun.
1617160377,1.0,Trying to install this on Mac OS X 10.6.5 fails. A 30-minute live chat with tech support (in India, naturally) resulted in them trying to give me instructions for a PC, leading nowhere. The tech had no idea what to suggest, was not familiar with the error messages I was getting. I then submitted a claim ticket to technical support via email detailing the problem (giving them the entire installation log), and after 4 days I have yet to receive a response of any kind. So, this is a review of the lack of support and customer service, and the defective installation aspect of the software, not its language instruction. It is hard to believe that one can pay this much for software that cannot even install itself, but apparently Rosetta has accomplished this. A brief tour around the Web suggests my experience is not unique. I cannot recommend this for Mac users.
1617160377,1.0,It's great until you upgrade your computer and need thier support...What is there not to love with this product; every aspect of the interface is great, until you get a computer virus and you need to install it on another machine.  Called into customer support, "Sorry can't help you, you'll need customer support not techncial support."  Wait, this is the customer support number, what is wrong with this picture?  Call next day, "Yeah, you'll need the proof of purchase from 4 years ago to re-activate.  Let us know when you find that."  If a software product requires re-activation, it should allow de-activiation of prior installs, like iTunes.  Now I have over $300 worth of useless CD's sitting in my desk drawer, compliments of RosettaStone.  BuyInstant Immersion Italian Levels 1,2 & 3or Fluenz and never have to worry about someone else's support problems.Get with the 21st century RosettaStone.
1617160377,3.0,This is my first experience using a Rosetta Stone product. For those who, like me, have never tried it before, here is a brief summary. The software immediately places you into an immersion (sights and sound) environment of still photography and phrases pertaining to the photos. You'll be asked to repeat phrases into the headset, and pronunciation counts (however, it's a great relief to those of us who can't roll our Rs that they allow for that!). You'll also need to type, and click on photos that match what is being said. This specific level attempts to teach basic Italian: colors, greetings and farewells, words that would come up in work and school environments, shopping basics, words for articles of clothing, animals, and the like.My background in learning foreign language is the old-style method of memorization. I would create flashcards of individual words. Repetitive writing by hand was one of the most helpful methods I used to learn--something that's not replicated with Rosetta Stone (though some typing is required). Rosetta Stone, in contrast to the old way of teaching, attempts to teach through immersion. Rather than memorization of one word, a word appears in context in a sentence (or shorter grouping of words), and English translations aren't shown. Rosetta Stone doesn't outright teach in English why a verb is conjugated the way it is, how to (or why you must) match an adjective to a noun, or have you learn specifically how to pronounce vowels and consonants. Instead, the software plunges you into learning by exposure to an all-Italian environment.However, this is exactly why Rosetta Stone may not work for a learner like me. Even though it's fun, it's nevertheless frustrating. I want to know how the words relate to my native language. While using the product, I can't help trying to translate everything into English and trying to understand why the grammar is the way it is. And because it's software, I can't go at my own pace. In high school and college, I would read forward to the next unit if I got ahead of my peers, and remove flashcards of words that needed concentrating on.Not knowing the rules of grammar can be frustrating to someone who learns the way I do. The software seems to be geared more toward those who learn visually. For anyone who has not already tried to learn a foreign language, or has found the old-style memorization method doesn't work for them, I would recommend trying Rosetta Stone. For those like me who have done very well with the old method, you may find it difficult to adapt to an immersion environment.
1617160377,5.0,Excellent and very intuitive. I would recommend this system to anyone. It seems so easy to remember.Hi quality presentation.
1617160377,4.0,I don't like the fact that they don't tell you what you're saying in English but only show a picture.And I'm having a difficult time deciding which word I use before a phrase depending on gender andplural or singular.  The instructions for the lessons are very unclear--not really any instructions!Thought this would help me on my trip to Italy but don't think it will.  Should have bought Rick Stevensbooks on Italian phrases and maps.
1617160377,1.0,Not a good program. Gets old very fast. No explanation of new words. Not engaging. Very expensive for what you get. I think most of the 5 star ratings are from paid reviewers because I just don't see what they see in the product.
1617160377,4.0,I like the immersion method, especially for languages than are in the same group as English. The progression is fun and in my opinion enjoyable. One thing though that I'm noticing is that there could be more tailering to the specific language across the product line as to content. There is also a lot of online content with Version 4 now that I'm really not into and comes with a free trial initially. I'd rather have more in the basic product itself but I think most people would like the online interactive material.I am still a fan of the teaching method but the DRM has just become even more bothersome and clunky than before. I didn't have any trouble with the initial install, the trouble is with reinstalling.If you're the kind of person that never has a problem with the computer that requires a reinstall, never reformats a hard drive for maintenance or other problems, then the copyright protections might not be an issue for you. However, I find them bothersome even when following the deactivation instruction and it has required several layers of contact with customer service each time-- even in pocession of deactivation code screen shots. Issues -were- eventually resolved.Hey, it's still pretty good software but I would want to know about convoluted DRM process before plunking down the hefty ticket price. So there.
1617160377,3.0,To me this software starts off way to redundant. You are given images of someone (or several someones) doing various things from cooking, running, swimming, eating, drinking, etc. After like the 100th time of seeing the same 4 images essentially repeat themselves in some manner I think I get it. Having said that I get it, I find it of no practical use in learning or using the language. Maybe for some people learning how to say "the little girls (boys, men, women) are running, eating, cooking, walking, sleeping, drinking", etc before learning to say Hey my name is *** followed by whatever, than maybe this is for you, but for my money I think Pimsleur is head and shoulders above this software. I give it a 3 star instead of 1 because it is sort of fun to play with and it helps your ego when you score the inevitable 100% correct at the end of each drill. Cheers
1617160377,3.0,I don't like how they don't tell you what it is at first, you have to figure it out. My husband is former military and I really don't know why they have this for them. I am learning this for traveling. Yes I have berlitz with CD and another book that has words with no CD. I have all different ways of learning, oh lets not forget the famous youtube. I feel for what they charge for Rosetta it should be a lot better. I'm just grateful I didn't have to go to the book store and buy it.
1617160377,5.0,I have tried to learn Italian for many years, and finally feel like I am making progress thanks to this software. It is easy and intuitive to use and I find the lessons fun rather than a chore. So, enjoy and arriverderci!
1617160377,2.0,I've tried Rosetta Stone once before, and was not impressed by it. I tried this product, and again found it also to not be a very effective tool at teaching a foreign language.I've tried a number of software products for foreign languages, and what I've found to be most useful is really something most similar to a standard classroom lecture. I can't learn from the Rosetta Stone method, and found that my retention after a day was pretty much close to zero.
1617160377,1.0,I called Rosetta Stone & inquired whether or not this particular version FINALLY had 2 KEY components, which have inhibited my buying their product over the years. The 2 components are a grammar/structure aspect & also a dictionary. My inquiry was met with a brash "No, it does not & Rosetta Stone will never incorporate those features."Firstly, let me assure you I'm well-aware of the superiority of the immersion technique, as the primary means of teaching, & am therefore not stating Rosetta Stone should deviate from this methodology of teaching language(s). All I AM stating is that these 2 components would complement & facilitate the process!The representative kept parroting the same, "Our language system is #1 in the world & by & large everyone loves & bla bla bla..." He went on to state that "If you complete all 5 Levels, then you have mastered the language & that there'd be NO need for a dictionary." Yes, you read that correctly!!! So I asked the guy, "Is every word in any given language's dictionary contained within the 5 Levels of the course?" He said, "No, but it wouldn't need to be." What an ignorantly-indoctrinated imbecilic answer!!!So I improvised a real-world example, whereby a dictionary would be useful. I asked, "What if, upon mastering all 5 Levels, I saw something interesting on the news about Italy & wanted to call my aunt in Italy & say, 'Aunt Mary, I just saw a segment on the local news about Naples." Okay, now what if the word SEGMENT was not contained within those 5 Levels or even if it was, but I'd forgotten how to say it? A Dictionary would OBVIOUSLY be needed!!! His response was, "You could go online & talk to one of our Language Tutors." Of course I replied, "What if I just want to get the bloody word?!?" Again, he reiterated "Rosetta Stone will never incorporate those features in its program."His final words were, "I don't understand where you're going with this. Would you like to purchase 1 or more levels of the Italian program?" My final words (while laughing) were, "No, because it doesn't have a dictionary & you're too blind &/or stubborn to admit it's lacking one."
1617160377,5.0,ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language...naturally, quickly, without studying verb declention charts, memorizing vocabulary lists, or navagating grammatical oddities. However, there is an obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon. The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children. Any Linguist will tell you, children are hard wired to learn grammer, and to speak perfectly their native language. As we age, the ability to speak certain sounds disappears, and the ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears. Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally, or pronouncing certain native sounds, the door shuts. You can still learn, but not perfectly. This is why a russian who learns english, will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles. Also, this is why Russian constanant clusters are impossible to pronounce for English speakers. There are almost NO exceptions to this, except for language savants i suppose.However, as far as learning language in a natural way, on your own, ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do. As anyone knows who's studied foreign languages in high school or college, you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet. Then, you learn the most common words, along with the way basic verbs (TO BE, TO HAVE, TO KNOW, etc) are conjugated, how the nouns and adjectives interact, etc. ROSETTA STONE turns that learning process on its head, and the center of its do-it-yourself language class, is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system. The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your computer keyboard (in case your target language has a different alphabet, than the English alphabet), and the computer files, plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer. Also, the buyer recieves in the box, this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer.(plus a few simple instructions to get started.) Unlike the oldest voice recognition programs from a decade ago, this headset just sets the volumn level, and you are ready to go. Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet, you just learn to speak the first words a baby might speak..."cat, run, read, boy, girl, hello, 1,2,3,4,5,6", stuff like that. Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically, "BY EAR". First, not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear. Some musicians can hear a song, and they KNOW every chord they heard, and the notes, and can reproduce them instantly, because they can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR. Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument, and they need sheet music, and chord theory. WHY? Because some people are more right brain, others more left brain...maybe some people HEAR better, and others analyse better. So, if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word "ZIA" (Aunt), you will never GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah. When English speakers see a "Z", they will not pronouce "TS", as in German, Russian, Italian, etc. SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT THE ITALIAN "Z" OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE, you need to guess. THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work. You might hear TSEE-a, but if you see "ZIA", your brain will think it's hearing what it's used to hearing--"ZEE-ah", and that's what you will say. AND, the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation. Likewise, Italian has other sounds not at all like English, and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound, you may never get close to the correct sound. I have a good ear. But i couldn't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding "D" than english. I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the Italian language. At times, I would click on LANGUAGE LAB, where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word, as well as showing you the voice print, and how the native speaker's voice rises and falls naturally, during the pronounciation of the word. (Apparently for correct stress.) If you are 50% or less away from getting it right, you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are, to correct pronounciation. (Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word, so you can compair what you are saying, to that of a native speaker.) If your circle turns green, you are 80% or closer to perfect pronounciation. HOWEVER, this system DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. Once, i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes. I was UPSET, then angry, then bored, and finally, dejected. Frustration kills motivation, and I think that's why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people. IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation, at least i could TRY to figure out how to say it. I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point. The computer program doesnt say "The Italian 'G' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G'." Instead, you are suppose to just KNOW this.  Sometimes, i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly. For example, ROSETTA STONE wants you to roll your R's. But, very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound. So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R's as a mistake in pronounciation. The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part, and at times the mistakes start to stack up. IF you dont get thru a lesson with a good score, you'll need to repeat the lesson, and also repeat the offending word. (the program tracks a LOT of parameters, including how long its been since you have taken a lesson. Too long, and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again. But that's good.) All I can say, is when I could not pronounce a certain word, i almost never knew why. Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice, if you've an inability to say a certain word, you might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem, was that there is NOTHING in the kit, that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school. Sometimes, those photos that go with the spoken or written exercise, dont get the idea across very well. THE ONLY SOLLUTION, is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book, that covers basics of grammer, pronounciation, vocabulary, and all the other holes in the learning of the language, that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced. AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book, very cheap, that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely. "ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE" by Cristina Mazzoni, for around $8 new. I bought that book, and only then, were the grammer lessons beginning to make sense. ALSO, this book spends time in the beginning, to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced, and the way the Italian Alphabet is pronounced. You NEED to get a book like this, so you understand italian grammer, and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other problems with ROSETTA STONE. Everybody says "DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB, UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS". Because, depending on how fast, or slow, you are motivated to move thru the lessons, those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast. WAIT TO SIGN UP! ALSO, its good to know that you cant just sign up for language lab a day or two before you want to use it. THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT, to have a lesson. Besides the speach recognition problem, and the lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer, pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language, everything about ROSETTA STONE's classes are LOTS OF FUN. Really. They have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind. There are stories that help with reading, that are clued into your number of finished lessons. ITALIAN LEVEL ONE, for example, is divided into UNIT ONE, language basics, UNIT TWO, Greetings, UNIT THREE, Work and school, UNIT FOUR, shopping. By the time you finish that much of the course, you should be able to get around Italy, and make basic conversation. I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN, or two years of high school italian, or 1-2 Italian grandparents. ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting, and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit (language basics), so long as you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software. I wish i had waited for the langauge lab, because i'm SURE that would have helped. However, if you don't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months, its only $25 a month, for more time with those online tutors. All things considered, VOICE RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well. I'm sure most of the problems people have, come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language, rather than the program's inability to understand your voice. If you are speaking the language correctly, I would guess anywhere from 96-99% of the time, ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say. If some word (like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI) comes up, you can easily skip the word. There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach, increase your vocabulary, and engage you in an "immersion" type language adventure, like ROSETTA STONE can.  NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab. The only REAL problem is if you learn on your own, its hard to keep your motivation for learning high. You'll need discipline and some kind of reward, ie, a trip to Italy if you finish LEVEL 1? (Or maybe just a FELLINI film. Whatever rocks your boat.) Good luck with your language adventure, and ARRIVIDERCI!
1617160466,4.0,The program was great but when you are done you are not allowed to sell it or give it to a school or library so you end up with a very expensive bookend.
1617160466,2.0,Disappointed - Not as intuitive as I expected.  Learning style doesn't work for me.  Might try and find someone else that loves the product and try again using their study sessions as a guide...
1617160466,4.0,My daughter locves this language program.  She is learning the language very quickly.  Her boyfriend is also working with it and making good progress.
1617160466,4.0,I got this program for Christmas this year 2011. Its been about 2 days of using the program and i have to say i have learned more in those 2 days than i have in 5 years with other methods. I previously already knew some Japanese before starting this program but it was very broken and limited Japanese. I truly feel that if i keep at it with lessons i will be able to master this language within 4 years. That's about the time i have heard other people who have mastered the language say it took them in classes. I love the program and will be getting Italian next. Although, i already know broken and limited Italian as well. The Italian will be easier for me to learn i suspect. Its just a easier language to learn compared to Japanese. With how much Japanese i learned with the program in just 2 days of lessons, i suspect that i will master Italian in about 2 years. It's a good program and i am very happy with it. This method may not be for everyone. I am more of a visual learner and have photographic memory so maybe that is why i was able to pick up so much in just 2 days. To Visual learner's YES i do recommend this program.I do each lesson 5 times a day. I am already on core lesson 2. My ending score for core lesson 1 is about 98% in 2 days. What is in that lesson, i honestly did not know before i started the program. So before you buy this program you need to decide if your an audio or visual learner first. I do honestly feel that i will be able to learn at least half of any language that i plan to learn with Rosetta Stone. Thank you Rosetta Stone for making it easier and most importantly more FUN!This program does require you to think and remember. It won't do the memorizing and thinking for you. The writing part is difficult though and i think its more of a program to teach you to understand Japanese when spoken to you. The only thing i don't like about it, is it doesn't give you many options to record you, repeating the things its teaching you to make sure your pronouncing it all correctly.
1617160466,3.0,But I didn't buy the program to learn a bunch of words and not know how to use them.  I like the association with pictures.  I memorized them all but I didn't know how to use them.  It was kind of fun watching Japanese programs and listening to the music understanding a word or 2.  It was not fun still not knowing what was being said.RS might be great for some, but not for me.  I would like to know what I'm saying.  Am I saying the boy is on/over the table or the table is on/over the boy?  Eventually, I licked my wounds and gave up. I tried another program and in one lesson I feel as if I learned more about the Japanese language (sentence structure and some basic sentences and words) than with months (bought it 2 years ago really) of RS.I do not agree that we need verb conjugation and grammar.  No one really learns that way.  If we did, damn near everyone in the US would be bilingual because of HS language. After 4 years of Spanish or French who really leaves school knowing how to speak a 2nd language?  Plus, I'm watching my 3 year old niece pick up Spanish like she's drinking water.  She conjugates her verbs in both languages correctly over 90% of the time.  So obviously immersion works.  It's just a matter of finding what works best for you.
1617160466,3.0,I want to learn Japanese to travel to Japan and read signs/menus/media and speak with native speakers (of Japanese and Spanish); so I purchased both Rosetta Stone Spanish (1.5 years ago) and Japanese (last month). The Japanese tool provides some basics but has much room for improvement. The same difficulties exist with both.(1) The milestones frustrate learners greatly. Only a SINGULAR programmed response is acceptable; there is far too little information to discern it exactly (or even guess something close sometime); and as unacceptable responses mount negativity towards the product grows. This terrible feature (Milestone) should be eliminated or vastly improved.(2) The allowable pronunciation of some runes (boht Japanese and SPanish) is VERY tight, while it is quite loose on others. It is irritating & frustrating. The pronunciation aid screen provides additional insight, but there are a few letters I cannot produce acceptably. In Japanese Shi, Chi, and Sa are far too tight. The use should be able to LOOSEN these.(2a) Even after I produce an acceptable pronunciation, later in the lesson it is rejected. A HUMAN is needed to explain and help. The COMPUTER only defeats the learner's enthusiasm.(2b) In longer words and sentences, the same mispronunciation of the same runes is allowed. The program is inconsistent.(2c) What are you trying to teach? Can a native speaker understand the learner? If so, let it pass - even for single runes.(3) The estimated time for each lesson is FAR too low. To think, read the strange new Japanese runes, pronounce the words (acceptably), and try to impress them into memory requires effort.(4) When new words are introduced through a group of pictures, the learner islimited to SIGHT only. FOUR of the FIVE other senses are NOT ENGAGED. This is NOT AS ADVERTISED "learning the way you learned your first language."(5) Because of this, a collection of pictures (for example family members) should NOT be used to INTRODUCE new words. The method of sound plus 2 pictures then choice of 3 pictures, followed by one picture with audio and a choice of three, followed by audio and the same choice of three is FAR BETTER. At least it involves TWO SENSES.(6) A collection of 4 or more pictures should be programmed to keep the "NOT" choice until later among the choices. When the FIRST choice is "The person is not a DOCTOR" and there are 4 pictures, one of which is a doctor, it is difficult to pick out the correct picture. You may think you've given enough clues, but it is NOT a positive experience for the learner who is unsure what the word for doctor is.(7) I tried to return to UNIT 1 after the MILESTONE and the program does not allow it. You need a REVIEW OPTION.(7a) On my demand, I want to see pictures of NOUNS, their spelling, and AUDIO. When I learned my original language, I could do that via human interaction or media.(7b) On demand I want to see verbs also.(7c) I want to be able to get a definition, even if its only in Japanese using words I've already supposedly learned, on demand. For example, FUTARI. Eventually I had to ask a native speaker what it meant. At first I thought it meant standing, then smiling, then I gave up.
1617160466,5.0,Actually bought this for my daughter who is in the marines and was being sent to Japan , the item arrived in a timely fashion and she was able to start using it while home on leave, seemed to be very user friendly for a beginner
1617160466,1.0,After months of struggling with Rosetta Stone and learning next to nothing I picked up a Pimsleur Japanese course and in half an hour I had learned more and retained more than in all the months of using Rosetta Stone. I am an auditory learner, not a visual learner so Rosetta Stone was useless for me. I will stick with Pimsleur all the way, I have learned more in just a few half hour sessions than I ever dreamed possible. Too bad both programs are ridiculously expensive, I don't think either program is worth the price. Rosetta stone is worthless and I would only consider paying for a used copy of Pimsleur because a new one costs ten times what I would pay to learn the language. The price for both is about the same. A great program that is worth the price is Human Japanese, it is more structured than the other two and gives you a better grasp of the grammar than either of the others as well. Personally I use both Pimsleur and Human Japanese, Rosetta Stone is overpriced garbage.
1617160466,2.0,Rosetta Stone's Japanese software can only really be used in conjunction with other Japanese learning resources. In my experience, it is good for practice if you already know the material being covered. Learning from it as a sole resource is unreasonable. They simply don't spend enough time drilling vocabulary and there is pretty much no grammar being taught.Problem with Rosetta Stone is that they don't explicitly tell you anything in your native language.  Instead, they expect you to infer meanings and make your own connections. The problem with this is that the user will probably end up making the incorrect associations without a parent or teacher to correct them.  Many of the pictures (from which you are expected to derive fairly complex concepts at times) are overly ambiguous.  However, if you already know the language, the pictures can make sense... most of the time.If you are already studying Japanese and you simply need something to help you with listening comprehension, then that is pretty much all this is good for... and really, it isn't great for that.  For the price, you are much better off looking elsewhere.  The websites iKnow.jp, TextFugu.com, and Skritter.com come to mind.  You'll end up getting set back about the same amount of $$ as buying just Level 1 of Rosetta Stone Japanese, but the amount of content you receive is far greater and of a much higher quality.  If you are not interested in online study materials, the Pimsleur Japanese audio series is far superior to Rosetta Stone and also available right here on Amazon.com
1617160466,5.0,This was for my daughter and she loves it. It keeps her engaged and she has made great progress in a short amount of time.
1617160466,4.0,I just finished level 1 of Japanese, and from the time I started to now I've learned tons of Japanese. I can't say all of this was from Rosetta Stone, though. I thought Rosetta Stone was pretty good, but I don't think I could call it a standalone resource to learn Japanese. A major part of learning Japanese is mastering the katakana, hiragana, and kanji, and Rosetta Stone is definitely not the best way to do that. There's a section of the program that teaches katakana and hiragana, but I feel that Rosetta Stone has a pretty inefficient way of teaching the alphabet.I really liked Rosetta Stone's voice recognition. Not many other programs offer that. I had to turn up the speech precision difficulty though because I thought it was being too lenient on pronunciation. I definitely did not like the milestones at the end of each unit, which expect the user to speak his/her way through a "real life" situation. The problem is that even though language is dynamic and diverse, Rosetta Stone says there's a single specific response for everything, and it's not easy at all to guess this from the context.Rosetta Stone was great for teaching vocabulary, and I've retained most of what I've learned from it. To fill the shortcomings of Rosetta Stone, I've been using some other resources which I'll list here.Human Japanese: For the money, this teaches much more than Rosetta Stone can. It covers the alphabet, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural notes and it's a really interesting read.GENKI I: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese [With CDROM] (Japanese Edition) (English and Japanese Edition): I'm only a few chapters into Genki, but it's known as one of the best "real" textbooks for self study.Remembering the Kana: A Guide to Reading and Writing the Japanese Syllabaries in 3 Hours Each (part 1) (Japanese Edition): Dr. Heisig's Remembering the Kana was the quickest, most efficient way I could find to learn the kana.Remembering the Kanji: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters: Heisig's Remembering the Kanji has taught me several hundred kanji so far, and I still remember the ones I learned almost a year ago.I liked Rosetta Stone a lot, but it's too expensive for what it gives. For the same price as a single Rosetta Stone level, you could buy a much more diverse set of resources and learn a lot more. If money isn't an issue though, go for it. I think 3.5 or 4 stars is a good rating.
1617160466,3.0,I started off loving Rosetta Stone.  I still have a pretty good retention of the words in the first 8-10 chapters even several years later.  For this I'm giving it 3 stars.My frustration with the product began as images and their meaning started to become more complex.  For example, when you are trying to indicate that an item is in front of another item you really need to know what the perspective is.  Is it from my perspective or from the item's perspective?  Without a teacher, native speaker or some kind of reference material, this is only possible through a leap of intuition.  As my frustration with this type of problem rose, I eventually gave up on the program.It was only later that I found out that Rosetta Stone was actually teaching me the wrong words as well.  I happened to be at EPCOT in the Japan pavillion looking at some of their language books and I read that 'to read' is 'YOMU'.  Rosetta had taught me that "to read a  book" is "hon o yonde imas".  I asked the girl behind the counter about the apparent contradiction and she confirmed that 'yomu' is the proper verb.  I later learned that 'yonde' means 'to call'.  So I was learning "to call a book"?!  Needless to say, I was very disappointed not just in learning the wrong word but in now not knowing if I learned others wrong too.The final straw was when I went to Rosetta Stone and found that there was no option to upgrade without re-purchasing the software.  For the price of this software, a user should be paying to learn the language, not just buying a couple of CDs.  At the least I expected a trade-in program at just the price of shipping.  So, overall, not a positive experience.On a side note, I did the free version of Human Japanese for smart phone and quite enjoyed it.  Can't speak for the full version but I'm strongly tempted.
1617160466,3.0,The good news is Rosetta does a job of teaching vocabulary but you have to accept that you won't learn anything except vocabulary. There is almost no grammar or verb conjugation instruction which yes is boring but is necessary to learn a language and No, I don't believe this can be picked up by "immersion."Have you ever take a language class where the teacher showed you pictures of people driving and you thought, "Ah, that is a negative verb conjugation." No, yet this is how Rosetta expects you to learn-- without any instruction. I'm trying to learn a new language not play pictionary.Because I was annoyed with the lack of instruction, I bought the Genki textbooks and found a tutor (native speaker) who has taught me more in 4 hours then the 4 weeks I spent clicking on pictures. I'm still using the program because it is good vocabulary practice but my tutor rolled her eyes and laughed when I told her I was using Rosetta Stone to learn Japanese.
1617160466,4.0,I study foreign languages in my free time. Having said that, my preferences lean towards product that aid in increasing my confidence in speaking, reading, writing, and understanding. Generally, these programs have clear audio, pictures, simple grammar lessons, and clear breakdowns of phonetic structures for non-native speakers (being entertaining and cheap is always a plus!)Rosetta Stone is a wonderful vocabulary builder. The pictures and audio help store new words in long-term memory. The games *can* be fun and the lessons test listening skills and adaptive recall. With purchase, a user gains access to online tutoring sessions with a native speaker after completing chapter units (to try out their new skills.) Listening to the natural rhythm of native speakers in the program helps reduce accent and familiarize a user with the new language. There is a lot of content in level 1 of Japanese alone, which is broken into 4 units: Language Basics, Greeting/Introductions, Work/School, and Shopping. Each lesson builds on the last, helping the user retain vocabulary previously studied (but sadly, nearly prohibiting skipping ahead).Unfortunately, there are some major flaws:This isn't the fastest self-taught curriculum; you won't learn useful, everyday phrases right away. Sure, I understand "The cat is sleeping." Or, "The boy runs." That's good, but how am I to realistically apply this to practical conversation? It took hours of lessons to learn phrases like "goodnight," or "Where is the bathroom?"Grammar is never fully broken down. Users are left guessing how or why sentence structure or the Japanese particle system works (if they can even figure out what that is). Vocabulary, even with the pictures, is also vague at times. A child learning a new language uses a lot of guess work and is constantly corrected by parents in the early stages of language development. An adult, however, shouldn't need to make nearly as many mistakes as a babbling toddler, let alone without being constantly corrected. When confused about a word or phrase meaning, there is no direct translation available through Rosetta Stone itself- ever. I shouldn't need to use Google Translate to understand what I'm learning. It can be frustrating for absolute beginners. The phrases, when repeated listen for accuracy in the user's speech. However, one must only be about 80% correct for a sentence to register as right. I tested by saying and omitting words at times, and skimmed through the lesson with few problems. It's not that it's not okay to make mistake while learning, but proceed with caution. The words pop up as the user speaks them. Parts of a sentence that do not register as clear will appear in a more faded font. There were times when I spoke correctly, and still read faded font, second-guessing myself. (Though my sensei confirmed I was correct!)Lastly, despite having lots of content, the lessons can be insanely repetitive and even confusing at times. It's easy for beginners to get disheartened, or think that language isn't their niche due to a poor start with the wrong learning materials. Conversational Japanese is actually the easiest self-taught language I've studied, with consistent sentence structures and easily approachable sounds for native English and Spanish speakers.I used Rosetta Stone as a vocabulary builder along with my college JPN 103 class. I got what I paid for: increased confidence, greater fluency, and larger vocabulary. The catch is that I already mostly understood what and why words were ordered in each set. I recommend Rosetta Stone for people with some basic knowledge of Japanese language looking to build on what they already know, but definitely not for a novice. For the money, I can see how this would be an overwhelming frustrating disappointment. Invest in something with audio and a simple grammar book, some hiragana/katakana workbooks, and flashcards. Ganbatte!
1617160466,1.0,Rosetta Stone software is garbage.  Maybe it is very sophisticated or something... I can't get it to load on my computer.  The chat live service couldn't get it to work either.  For $250.00 I expect to get a great program that loads and i can start learning right away.  I wasted a whole day trying to get it to work.  For the price you should get all the printed materials with it, but... you don't.  Rosetta Stone should be run out of business.  I will never, NEVER buy another product from them and i will try to tell as many people as I can not buy one either.
1617160466,3.0,First of all, I haven't used this product yet (so why am I writing this?). What I'm reviewing is how the company is advertising their product, because to be perfectly honest it's turning me away from it more than drawing me to it. Rosetta Stone keeps boasting that it will "teach you the language the way you learned your first language as a child."That is complete bullcrap. And it is backed by both Linguistic research and Speech Pathology research. Let me break down what we currently believe happens in language learning, both with first language acquisition and the second.Our native language is learned while we're children. No one knows how or why, but babies and young kids are hardwired to pick up and tease apart sounds and grammatical structures in ways that adults CAN'T. This is because different parts of their brains are being used in this process. Babies aren't only learning by people showing them pictures, they're learning through context, human touch and intonation when spoken to, and simple observation of day to day life. THAT is immersion, and kids are fantastic at it. Kids are also better at learning second languages because they still retain the capacity to sort things out simply through those techniques.Adults can't. Some have an easier time than others. Immersion is still by far the best method because we're forced to try and make sense of what's going on. However, it's the hardest road for a beginner, and quite frankly, no computer program can ever teach by immersion because it doesn't have the qualities stated above as of yet. Just from what I'm reading and seeing, showing a picture and only pictures without translations isn't immersion, and it's definitely not language instruction. My Korean textbook tried this, and for me personally it failed completely. Adults need more guidance until they can get the human kind of immersion. Like what was said before I typed this, we need sounds and videos of examples of the same content.Immersion is learning with all five senses, which is why classrooms and most computer programs fail. Not everyone is a visual learner, just like not everyone can learn through textbooks. You need visual, audio, and even role-playing scenes to get material in your head. And while Rosetta Stone boasts there's no memorization, that's also not good for either children or adults. Guess what? Children memorize, they just do it without thinking about it because they're exposed to the same materials again and again. If you take away the ability to review past lessons and re-do exercises after certain milestones, you're eliminating half of what adults sadly do have to do in order to learn a language.I'm not trying to cast a bad light on Rosetta Stone or anything, I would still like to try the program. I have just graduated university with a degree in Japanese and a minor in Linguistics, and I would like to have a reliable resource to practice with so that I don't lose my skills. But I need repetition, and if this program doesn't allow for that, then I will have to sadly take my money elsewhere.Stop advertising that you're teaching the way we learn as kids, because we don't learn like we did as children, and no computer program as of today's technological capacity can simulate that immersion. It comes off more like a cheap imitation than a program that knows what it's doing.
1617160520,5.0,This program starts out simple yet challenging. I love the extra support online to practice with that comes in the package.
1617160520,1.0,We were happy to receive rosetta in time for Christmas. My son wash`t able to get this up and going to learn.  He called the company and still wash`t able to install it.  The rep said other customers were also having problems.  Very disappointing.  It was to be the present he really wanted
1617160520,5.0,I bought this to learn Korean. I've always wanted to learn many different languages.This is a fun and great way to do that! I love it, and hope to get some more money saved to buy more levels! ;)
1617160520,3.0,Rosetta stone is a good tool for learning Korean, but I have to supplement it with grammar materials. I think that for the price, I should not be required to buy anything else to effectively learn the language. Considering there are so few resources for English speakers learning Korean, this is among the best. I really appreciate the speaking and listening. The grammar is not very helpful as I was unsure what most of the rules were that I was supposed to employ. The writing was way too hard. It went from copy small syllables to writing sentences perfectly with no forgiveness for even teh slightest error, even if it was just spacing.
1617160520,5.0,My daughter is using this to learn Korean and loves it.  Well worth the money.  The learning process Rosetta uses is great.
1617160520,1.0,I might recommend to all of you an alternative..I learned how to read Korean in less than an hour and am learning Korean very quickly here are the sites..they are 100% free and work hundred times better than this expensive things. here are the sites for you the first is [...] and the 2nd site is [...] These sites are amazing and you can even interact with the teachers. They even have an online bookstore where you can find extremely affordable books and cds I am purchasing them already. Hope you enjoy the sites!
1617160520,5.0,I chose to buy this product since I will be studying abroad in South Korea. I'm half way through the course, but I can already say that I feel a lot more confident now than I was before. This program is different in that at first, you honestly have no idea what you are doing, but as the course progresses, you repeat, and therefore learn, not just memorize, the language! You will only find this beneficial if you are dedicated about learning and take it as a new language instead of trying to make sense of syntax, diction, etc. i also transferred my program from one mac to another and it runs smoothly. CALL CUSTOMER SUPPORT BEFORE YOU DO THIS!**Couldn't be happier!
1617160520,1.0,This program is a waste of time and money.  After paying for this overpriced software package, a few months later they hit you with more charges to maintain your account. The program does nothing more than show you pictures and then says the words in Korean.  They never bother to teach anything or give you a way to learn what they are saying except by the picture. Most of the time the picture is confusing and doesn't help explain what your supposed to be learning. I regret making this purchase, wish I could get a refund.
1617160520,5.0,My daughter has only just started using this so I can not tell whether or not it will help her become fluent in Korean, but she is enjoying using it and it works well (not difficult to set up or use on her laptop).
1617160520,5.0,Came quickly and was just as described. Have just began to use it and is making learning new language so much easier. Works great!!
1617160520,2.0,I bought this program to help prepare myself to teach English in South Korea. As a linguist and ESL teacher, I know the limitations of such programs, compared to taking a course or making friends with a speaker of the other language.The best use of Rosetta Stone is for visual learners to pick up basic vocabulary. Even if there were a RS 2 or 3 for Korean, which there isn't, it still wouldn't help you much beyond that. A picture dictionary provides the same benefit, though. It would have far more words than RS does, for $90 cheaper, and it'd be easier to carry around. Plus you could add related words in the margins! Get one with a CD, so you can mimic the pronunciation.The language quality for Rosetta Stone products is hit or miss. For languages such as Spanish or French, the language is perfect. For Korean or Hindi, though, RS products stink. They're full of language errors! Language learners won't know that they're learning bad Arabic or Korean, until they finally make a friend from that culture. By that time, they don't need RS anymore. You'd think their quality control would be much better.There's also an issue with poor service. Years ago, I misplaced my disk 1. This was years ago. RS wants to charge me an exorbitant amount to replace that disk, even though I still have disk 2, so obviously I'm not trying to scam them. So I deducted a star for poor service.My advice for LL is:1. Get a picture dictionary with a CD.2. Stay motivated! Study regularly! Use what you know! Get lots of rest!3. Take good language courses with real instructors who care about you.4. Find ways to make friends with people who speak that language. You might do a language exchange, and teach each other your mother tongues!Blessings.
1617160520,1.0,I bought this product or an earlier version of it some time ago.  It was sold with a guarantee, but when I wrote to get my money back, I never got an answer.Why did I want my money back?  Well, I was not learning Korean with it despite hundreds of hours with it [I only stuck with it because I had spent so much money and knew of no available alternative at that time].  The pictures were ambiguous and in a few classes unclear [I am not used to seeing a horse's head up so close that I can't recognize it. There is a picture showing a leg and a foot -- which one is meant?  What is being said with the guy falling off in the rodeo or the guy on the skateboard?].  It took me a long time to figure out the prepositions of place without any explanation.The program also doesn't allow for the fact that there are not one-to-one mappings from "observation" to a target language for  all prepositions of place [think of the diverse uses of the English preposition of place "on"]. In Korean, the words for red and blue have a contrasting initial consonant, that I cannot hear in the program, but the second consonant, though written the same, sounds distinctly different to me.  Maybe these are allophones, maybe not:  But RS is no help here.I worked HARD on this program.  It was one of the most frustrating experiences in my life.  In fact, I got to the point where I knew all the answers but still had no idea what I was saying in 10~20% of them.  The review system seemed faulty:  I would be tested again and again on words and phrases I already knew and got correct -- and not get out of the loop.  This is NOT how I learned my first language.  [Besides that, as an adult, I don't expect, and research does not indicate, that I will learn L1 and L2.]  Here are two places where some guidance would have been helpful:1] Korean has two systems for counting, pure Korean and Sino-Korean.  There are specific applications for each, e.g., for how much something costs versus how things are being bought.  RS teaches one set of numbers, but then times are taught, with-out any explanation that the numbers just learned are simply a different system than what applies to the hours of the day.  2] Korean only uses plural markers and subjects when they are not clear from the context.  But RS seems to be ignorant of this, very early on make a big to-do [as I would if I were teaching English, German or Spanish, for example] of the difference between 'banana' and 'bananas.'  This certainly did not help me when I got to Korea and tried to buy things!The speakers speak rapidly.  This is a natural speed for Seoul natives.  But some allowance should be made for 1] learners and 2] the reality that people in some parts of Korea speak much more slowly.Even  more of the content is questionable: A Korean friend said that the sentences were unrealistic.
1617160520,5.0,So far, I love it! Rosetta Stone is a great way to learn a language. Basically the way I am learning Korean is the way I teach my 18 month old English-lots of visuals and repetition.
1617160520,3.0,After completing the first CD, I have to say I'm a little disappointed. If 1 CD is meant to roughly equal a semester, then it probably falls a little short, and is priced about the same. In sheer vocabulary, it's definitely good, but the phrases it teaches are a little nonsensical - why must I know how to say a table is made of metal, before I learn how I learn how to say "I don't understand," or "what?" (neither phrase taught on this CD). Good at what it does, but it's more of a supplement than anything else.
1617160520,5.0,Daughter asked for just this for her birthday and she is currently learning Korean she loves it and does not regret it.
161716058X,3.0,I'll be a little more forgiving than PsychKid.1. Before you buy this product, learn your Farsi alphabet and how it works.2. look for some introductory videos on youtube for common vocabulary, etc. to make sense of the wording.3. Have Google translate and a Persian/English keyboard ready.4. Be patient. VERY PATIENT.5. Find some Farsi/Dari speakers.Judging how Spanish is relatively easy for an English speaker to pick up (similar culture, nearly identical alphabet, etc.), I'd assume it'd be easier for Arabic, Urdu, etc. Arabic-script speakers to pick up on Farsi for the same reasons (similar cultures, nearly identical alphabets). Until then, just be ready to run several times over the same exercise, before you can crawl through with some easy vocabulary.
161716058X,1.0,I'm writing this because this is a waste of money, you won't learn as much as you could. Best way I can describe it, is that it's much like as if you were to learn Farsi in school with a bad teacher. You'll find yourself not knowing what you're saying, and confused. If you actually want to learn Farsi, buy Pimsleur, you'll actually learn the language and for a much cheaper cost. Also, worst thing is, you can't return the product, so you will be out 170$. Don't make the same mistake I did!
1617160644,5.0,Wonderful program to start a new language. I purchased it as a gift and I can see results very fast.
1617160644,4.0,Enjoyed being able to practice online on the ipad and on my Android phone. Too bad that is only for 90 days, though.
1617160644,3.0,I'm about halfway through level 1 and I've had a few issues. Sometimes it's hard to see exactly what they are trying to show you with the pictures. For one example there's 2 pictures side by side with a very similar word. In one picture there are two swimers in a lane, in one they are both going the same direction,and in the other they are going opposite from each other. What does the word mean? I asked my polish boyfriend and he had to actually call his family to get clarification. It turns out this word is very rarely used in every day polish.... so why is it in level 1?I guess I would want to have a "help" button with text explanations. Other than that the software is really easy to use and even fun!
1617160644,5.0,Great product to begin learning from scratch. No English involved. The lessons use pictures to teach instead. Headset was unnecessary as most computers have a microphone and speakers. Definitely not something to practice in public as sounds interfere with the spoken lessons.
1617160644,4.0,I bought this for my girlfriend because she wants to learn Polish so bad since I am 100% Polish, so she sits and goes through the exercises while I do my homework and its nice because I can always help her out when she is stuck.
1617160644,5.0,Watched my son learn at least 10 different phrases in probably about 15 minutes!  The headphone/microphone helps you clearly hear what how to pronounce the words as well as repeating them correctly.  I highly recommend this product!
1617160644,3.0,Just as many others have said very eloquently, words keep changing in Polish due to the nature of the language.  The rules for this can not be intuited from the immersion technique in Rosetta Stone.  Even if you can recognize "psa" and "pies" as both "dog", and even if you can recognize "dwa", "dwie", "dwoje", "dw&oacute;ch", etc. as all being the number two (and this alone is a challenge), there is simply no way to be able to predict which of these you are supposed to use and when.  That said, Rosetta Stone Polish IS fun.  Just learn some Polish through other means first, and then come back here after you've gotten past an introductory level elsewhere.If you are looking for a FUN computer program that teaches you Polish and teaches you the grammar rules of Polish along the way, I recommend Polski Bez Problemu +, Levels 1-3, instead.  If you go this route, make sure you get the + version, as the one without is just a textbook and some MP3s.  But it is the software that makes this purchase valuable, as it has interactive exercises that adapt to your mistakes.  Do a web search on Supermemo World EU, because it is made by a company based in Poland and is therefore often out of stock on Amazon.  SeePolski Bez problemu!+ Elementary Level A1-A2 (Book & CD-ROM)for my review of Level 1.If you are an absolute beginner in Polish, I would actually recommend that you first get an audio-only course, such as Pimsleur Polish 1 Comprehensive or Michel Thomas Method--Total and Perfect Polish.  (SeePolish, Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Polish with Pimsleur Language ProgramsandTotal Polish with the Michel Thomas Method (Michel Thomas Series)), and then later move on to things like Polski Bez Problemu + and/or Rosetta Stone.  I go into more details about all this in my Pimsleur Polish 1 Comprehensive review.
1617160709,3.0,I enjoy using Rosetta, but I think there are better ways to learn a language.  It takes a very, very, very long time before you learn the things you really need to know -- Where is the bathroom?  Where is the train station?  How much is this?It's enjoyable to use because of the pictures and different ways the software interacts with you.One thing you should know -- the online services, which sync between your home PC and iPad or iPhone -- there is only 3 months included with this purchase.  After that, there is a pretty substantial charge -- the 3 month extension is $49.I figure there should be more than 3 months included for this very expensive piece of software.I'm still using Rosetta, but I have also switched to an audio Pimsleur -- which is getting me into daily speaking MUCH FASTER!
1617160709,2.0,This course may be fun for some, with lots of things to do. But if you are looking for something that will help you interact in the country, you may find out this won't take you far. Perhaps you'll need to buy all the levels for that, but at their price you may end up bankrupt!!
1617160709,5.0,Rosetta Stone is the best. No translation no grammar. Only listening and repeating. THis way is the only one to learn Languages.
1617160709,1.0,I completed rosette stone portuguese (theres only 3 levels instead of 5), I was shocked at how little portuguese I knew.  I dropped a couple hundred bucks on this product.There are far better alternatives.1.  babbel.com  &lt;&lt; 10 bucks a month, PLUS a review manager that gives you the words you dont know more often and the words  you do know less often.  Rossetta stone is linear, it doesnt learn what you dont know.2.  pimsleur  &lt;&lt; this is GREAT for getting up to speed on speaking only. (no reading or writing).I wouldnt say rosetta stone is useless, it does teach you some, but its pretty close.  Its all marketing, far better products out there dont waste your time please.
1617160709,4.0,The only reasons this gets 4 stars and not 5 stars is, because it does a great job teaching you the material, it does not bore you to death.I believe it does teach you the fundamentals of the language etc etc.So its good, but the price is just a down size. This is probably the most over priced company there is. SO ---This is what i recommend:Download the trial.If you like it and believe its worth the money, then there is no reason why you should not buy it.Otherwise there are plenty of other software that is also great and under $50 i will not advertise any, but do your research!
1617160768,5.0,This learning program is really good. I went through the first two units and I already can understand and speak basic things. It's visually captivating, so you learn more easily. And the biggest advantage is that you get to have live sessions with a native speaker and other learners. I enjoy these immensely! The only thing that troubles me is: how much of this program changes for another language? (I think that, if they repeat the same pictures and similar structures, it would be less captivating and therefore less efficient the second time around.)
1617160768,5.0,This programme changed my life forever! within the first lesson youre speaking the language, which helped me get sooo much closer to the hot moscow student who was living next door this summer...:-) thanks for getting me laid, rosetta stone!!!
1617160768,5.0,I want to start of by saying do not buy this product with the idea that it alone is all you need to become fluent. Levels 1-3 will give you a good foundation in the language and probably some fairly good speaking skills - but you will still have a ways to go. Also, sadly, you will not have developed very much conversational skills after this first level. You will learn some "need-to-know" stuff, yes, but stuff that you will most likely not use very much. There are sentences like "The cat is in the hat" and "The keys are in the shoe". I understand the reasoning behind forming sentences like this (prepositions and the prepositional case), but you would think that more focus would be paid on actual conversational skills.Another gripe is that the images are not unique to the language. You would think that if you pay over $200 bucks for one level (and over $500 for all three) that you would be getting something unique. Having said that, there is a wide range of different Russian speakers throughout level one - all very pleasant and easy to understand.The online features are absolutely great. This is one reason why it's earned four stars from me. I honestly think Rosetta Stone could really make some money if they separated the software and their online stuff.So, to sum everything up: this is a good, addictive, and interactive product; but it definitely shouldn't be your only resource. Buy some books to understand some of the grammar, and try to get yourself a dictionary or always have Google Translate handy and ready to go. Also, try to hook up with some native speakers via Skype or something, especially if you want to learn some real conversational skills. You can probably learn more in a few hours with a native speaker (when it comes to day-to-day conversations) than Rosetta Stone Russian level 1 will teach you.
1617160768,4.0,I am so glad Rosetta Stone made their product more affordable by offering the lessons in sections, rather than buying the entire set at once.  The pictures are how one learns, so no matter what YOUR native language is you can learn. There is some confusion as to what the pictures mean until I contacted support and was steered in the right directions as to find the meaning in my own language.
1617160768,5.0,In just a few days I could speak with my boyfriend. I find myself understand Russian conversations and being able to keep track of whats going on, Im not fluent by any means but I have learned a lot in the short periord I have been studying. Love it and owuld recomend to anyone
1617160768,2.0,I would like to be able to review this product in more detail, but I can't since I have yet to be able to activate the online services. The activation code doesn't work because it keeps telling me that I don't have internet access.  Obviously I do have internet access or I couldn't write this review.  I have contacted customer service and they have been zero help. I have also asked to have this escalated to a manager but the woman I've been working with refuses. It's been over a month and I can't get anyone to actually help me.
1617160768,5.0,The course is pretty much as they advertise.  The visual and audio teaching technique is effective and fun: it keeps you from getting bored!  The only downside of the course is the smartphone feature: you can use it free for 30 days, but then they want to charge you.  For the price of this course they should include that!  It's a good course, and I would certainly purchase the next level.
1617160768,5.0,This was for daughter (20) whose boyfriend's parents are from Russia and she is already conversing with them which they love!
1617160768,1.0,I got this for my 17 year old son for Christmas, and after multiple attempts he was unable to make it work on his computer.  He discovered this is a common problem with this software.  He contacted customer support, but it still wouldn't work.  Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the problem until it was too late to return it.  Overall it was not a good transaction, and we're not happy with the product.
1617160768,3.0,I have not been able to get the headsets to work properly on my Mac book.  I have not had the time to investigate more closely and troubleshoot  As far as learning Russian goes, this isn't for sissies.  I find it difficult to hear the fine nuances of the pronunciation so I refer often to the phonetic breakdown of the words.  It is a slow process.  I had high expectations for this product, but for some odd reason, I seem to be learning more Russian by reading Russian for dummies.  I'm not giving up on this.  The jury is still out.  I'll update my rating accordingly should things &#34;click&#34; better for me down the road.
1617160768,5.0,I recommend Rosetta Stone every chance I get, not that they need it. There is a reason they have the great reputation they do: They've earned it. The fact that I can use it on my iPhone adds a level of usefulness that's hard to overstate.
1617160768,1.0,I am heading to Russia on a mission trip soon and purchased this product. It is totally useless. It in no way prepares you for the short term that one would be in another country. The basics do not exist. I don't want to read Russian, I do not want to conjugate verbs in Russian, I just want the basics that one would need like hello, good bye, please to meet you, where's the bathroom?....you get the point. If you are looking for the basics DO NOT buy this. iPhone apps are far better and they are free. If you want to speak Russian and read russian and write Russian, go for it. Just know I have a useless piece of software sitting around.
1617160768,1.0,Buyer Beware!  I purchased a Russian language Rosetta Stone for my son who traveled to Russia last summer.  He ended up using the program almost not at all, so it's basically brand new.  We just listed it on Ebay, because it is no longer of any use to us.  We were notified by EBay that it's a copyright violation to sell any Rosetta Stone products.  (Apparently it's in the small print when you load the program onto your computer.)So, if you think you will buy it and try it or use it for a trip and sell it when you're finished, think again.  It's yours and you will not be able to recoup your money.
1617160768,5.0,I tried another Russian language instruction program...mostly on-line, but it just wasn't working for me.  I decided to pay the extra and get Rosetta Stone.  Glad I did!  This is much more intuitive, interactive, fun.  It makes me say & pronounce words and phrases exactly to pass to the next one, level.  I got so much more from this approach.  Love it!
1617160768,5.0,I decided to try out learning Russian with Rosetta Stone, and I think that I've made a good choice.The program is easy to use, just like all Rosetta Stone products. I would recommend learning at least the alphabet before starting, as that definitely helps the program make more sense. This actually comes with an alphabet guide, but you should probably use another source to learn it. Also, learning some grammar before starting could be of much use. I remember having absolutely no idea which choice to make on many of the grammar questions early on. This is alright, however, as you'll end up figuring it out mostly by using Rosetta Stone.As I'm an absolute beginner, I did like that Rosetta Stone just starts off with vocabulary. It gives a good feel for the pronunciation of words and other basic concepts. I must admit, though, that it was pretty scary to start the very beginning lesson with a near impossible-to-pronounce word, devushka ("girl" in the English alphabet). Aside from that, the program starts off nicely with vocab, and progresses to grammar and some basic conversation. It becomes even more complex once each core lesson (and then unit) is mastered. The "standard" course is perfect for learning the language overall, although there are different courses that can specifically focus on speaking, reading, or writing. There are also standard courses with different introductions, extended courses, and placement tests.Some people may not like Rosetta Stone's style of full immersion. I suppose it does make some parts difficult, but it also teaches you better than simple translations.I'd definitely recommend this product. I'm not even done using it yet, but it's taught me a lot of Russian and I will be getting the next levels.
1617160768,5.0,You get out of something, that which you put into it. I have a Russian spouse and son. We have been married for over 9 years and I am ashamed to admit that I have not learned more of the Language. Russian and Chinese are to number 1 and 2 most DIFFICULT languages to learn. However, my wife is worth it and it will unite out family with one common language. These days knowing two ore more languages is both a blessing and benefit. Russians have a beautiful culture and are wonderful people. Thank you, Amazon and Rosetta Stone for bringing me closer to my dream to speak Fluent Russian to my wife and child!
1617160768,5.0,bought this for my husband, he is still working with it, but we had to get some other aides to help him along.
1617160768,5.0,Easy to use, quick results.. Can't Beat It!! I learned so much in a short amount of time, I look foward to advacning to the next levels.
1617160911,5.0,Rosetta Stone is very effective in its ability to teach the language by putting you right in the middle of the language.  I highly recommend Rosetta Stone to anyone interested in learning another language.
1617160911,4.0,I'm going to Spain next Spring and I need a lot of help in developing Spanish conversational skills. I have just begun the adventure of using Rosetta Stone to get started. I have a long way to go, but it has provided me with a high comfort level in assimilating a new language. I have been to Spain before and thoroughly enjoyed it, but being able to converse in Spanish should increase the joy of being there. I have enjoyed the lessons very much. Additional information: I'm an 86 year old student.
1617160911,1.0,This is not the best approach for learning Spanish.
1617160911,5.0,This software was actually recommended by a friend.  It installs well and we just started using it so we'll know how well this helps us learn Spanish a few months from now.  We've used other applications before but I think this will be the one that wins out over all the rest.
1617160911,4.0,Having never been real successful with foreign languages. I hope that I can learn Spanish this way.  The course has limitations.  Computer on line access is one  According to the organization either purchase the entire course and basically forget the first level as you will be rebuying it.  The course offering as levelsare only offered on line.  Appears that the company only offers the first course by CD. The on line cost was 49 dollars month? According to the operator on the phone, I question their marketing technique
1617160911,2.0,I'm a linguist by training, with a focus in how people learn languages.  The concept behind Rosetta Stone is based on the observation that children can induce the grammar of their mother tongue from examples in which the specific functions of linguistic units are contrasted.  As Rosetta Stone would have it, since children learn effortlessly this way, then why not adults?The problem is that children require millions of impressions to induce the grammar.  Also, when mature humans learn a second language, the syntax of the first language interferes with the notions one constructs of the second.  It's therefore highly inefficient to teach language this way.  With adults it's actually much more efficient to be more explicit about the grammar of the target language -- to provide clear descriptions of the rules accompanied by many examples and much practice.  Immersion can be very useful, but not to the exclusion of explicit instruction in the rules of the language.  I found myself playing a tortured game of 'find waldo', trying to figure out, say, is X the feminine form of some plural article?  One ends up learning a few wooden formulae, but not learning the structure of the language.Aside from this, I found the software implementation to be very weak.  The whole activation mechanism is painful.  If you switch computers or re-install the OS on a machine, you have to go through a tortured process with Rosetta Stone support to obtain a working activation code.  Versions 3 and 4 failed to co-exist on my Win7 x64 system.  When I tried to use V3, an installer was kicked off which quickly failed, after which neither Version 3 nor 4 worked, and I had to reinstall both -- which required the laborious process of obtaining new activation codes (for some reason).  Oh, and forget refunds, if you purchase from Amazon, none are given, even if the software stops working on your machine.The software itself seems to be written using some cross-platform tool that reminds me of Macromedia Director -- hell, it may be just that.  It's laggy, the fonts are ugly, the images are full of artifacts, the UI looks like it was designed by a software intern with no design experience.  The tool to judge pronunciation is horribly insensitive in Version 3 (I speak other Romance languages, so I can tell), and in Version 4 they adjusted to customer complaints by making it far more tolerant, so now it's a joke -- one can score green even with comically distorted renditions of the cues.Here is a complaint letter written by a developer to the CEO of Rosetta: [...]Overall, I suggest steering away from this product.
1617160911,5.0,I get excited when I succeed in learning the lessons! It is fun and challenging. I hope I have some good language skills by September and our trip to Spain.
1617161004,1.0,We bought this product 5 years ago prior to a trip to Stockholm. It is Version 2; I think they are now on Version 3. Started it and basically learned to say, "A boy in a boat." Got very busy with family matters and put it aside for the time, thinking I could go back to it at any time. My computer crashed and I got a new one. Finally got time and am planning a trip to Stockholm again. Got it out tried to install with no luck. Called support. Apparently my version is no longer supported. So got sent to another operator, who was very nice, but was limited in what she could offer to help me. Was informed that I could upgrade to the current version for $49.99. I was very disappointed that I could not use the program for which I had already paid a fairly substantial price. How much would it cost the company to help me install my current software or send me a new disk? Be aware that you might not be able to re-install your software in the future.
1617161004,1.0,Expensive and very boring!  I could not motivate myself to learn with this method!  There must be a better way!!
1617161004,2.0,Let me preface this by saying I speak five different languages, English is my native tongue but I also speak French, German, Latin and Mandarin.  I am very well familiar with pronounciation of vowels and dipthongs not normally found in my native tongue.That having been said, I find the Rosetta Stone software's ability to rate my speech as extremely poor.  It often refuses to recognize my voice pronouncing words (and even single syllables).  Moreover, when I repeat a word or phrase into the microphone, it often does not recognize that I have stopped speaking, and the software simply sits there doing nothing. If it were human it would be wearing an idiot's grin.  I am not exaggerating when I say that I repeat a one-syllable word and the program sometimes takes up to 20 seconds to acknowledge it (whether I pronounced the word correctly or not is immaterial). Note that I am using a state-of-the-art PC, so hardware isn't the issue.Furthermore, the Rosetta Stone "immersion" approach to language learning is not good for anyone who has learned a second or third language through formal lessons.  The software is designed to NOT take your native tongue into account, but the only benefit of that is to Rosetta Stone, NOT the learner.  Many languages have sets of rules regarding gender agreement or unorthodox pronounciation; most languages have regular rules about conjugation.  RS imparts NONE of these rules; doing so would require an explanation in every native tongue.  Instead, you are left to figure it out on your own. This seriously impedes the process.  What this product will do is teach you to speak BAD Swedish.In short, if this is your first attempt at learning a non-native language, it might work for you.  But if you have any experience in multiple languages, RS will likely leave you feeling frustrated.
1617161063,1.0,I am Turkish. My American husband bought Rosetta Stone and tried quite a few times and it simply didn't work. Like other reviewers, he can say "girl on top of horse" , "boy under the ball" etc but it never helps to put it together to talk. When I read Rosetta Stone's reply to another reviewer here, it made me think that it was full of buzzwords that doesn't explain why it seems it doesn't work for anybody so far. Later, my brother-in-law, who was very interested in learning Turkish, also got this course and I don't see that it helps him either.There is a distance learning system from Ankara Univeristy - TOMER , the organization is equivalent to Goethe Institute or Alliance Francaise, as it is used by people who came to study in Turkish Universities. My husband didn't use this program but I had university friends from Madagaskar and Kenya who could follow classes in Turkish after attending this school in Ankara for one year. Now it seems they have a computer-based distance learning course and the price is not that much.[...] The site does require Internet explorer.We will also check Pimsleur Turkish method as I liked their system when I found a Japanese Pimsleur set and am pleased with it.Hope this helps.
1617161063,1.0,First, they are very expensive. I went to Turkish public school for 2 years. Got this as a review. I was able to go through it in 40 minutes. But I can not see how anybody that does not speak Turkish be able to learn Turkish from this. NOT POSSIBLE! It is IMPOSSIBLE! Don't believe the advertisements. Don't waste your time or money.
1617161063,1.0,Simply put: it doesn't work. Rosetta Stone claims to design their software based on the idea that you can learn a second language the way you learned your first one, through so-called immersion. First of all, using Rosetta Stone hardly qualifies as immersion. Secondly, anyone who has studied second language acquisition knows that adults do not and should not learn language as if they were children. It may sound easy because most of us don't remember much about learning our first language, but if you think about it from a common-sense perspective you will realize that even a ten-year old native speaking child still makes many errors. Do you want to spend ten years trying to learn a second language? Second language acquisition programs should take into account the fact that adults have many more language and cognitive skills that they can employ in their language study than children do. A well-developed program would account for this and use this to the learner's advantage. Rosetta Stone does not do this.From a motivational standpoint it is also a very discouraging program. As others have said, it doesn't teach you how to communicate. Pimsleur's audio programs, while still limited in some ways, have the advantage of teaching you language that allows for immediate conversation (or immediate conversation with people you don't know well.) I found it very encouraging that I was able to use the Turkish I learned in my first lesson to strike up a conversation with a Turkish man I met at an international dinner at my university. All I did was asking him if he was a Turk and respond that no, I am American when he asked me if I was Turkish. (You can imagine how please I was to be asked.) But with Rosetta Stone you won't be able to do this. You'll be able to say hello and then point to the people at another table and make the astute observation that they are eating a meal.It is unfortunate that the program is not more useful because resources for Turkish study are quite limited. But until Rosetta Stone learns to incorporate some conversational skills and sound SLA theory into their programs I would suggest avoiding them unless you have money to burn.
1617161063,1.0,I was so happy to see a review from someone else who struggled with this software!! My fiance is Turkish and I spent HOURS painstakingly using Rosetta Stone, only to be able to say random nouns and sentences like "The boy is in the plane" or "The girl is under the table". The only way I even grasped that much was thanks to him sitting next to me helping translate words so that I didn't confuse words like 'sitting' and 'listening'.I should note that learning languages comes easily to me. I am a native English speaker, fluent in Spanish, excelled at reading Latin for years, and also was at one point moderately capable in Italian after a year of instruction in college. Rosetta Stone Turkish left me frustrated and incapable of communicating with my future in-laws. Save your money!!!
1617161063,1.0,I purchased the online version of this product because I want to learn Turkish.  If you are serious about learning Turkish do not buy this. You will not learn any grammar at all and there is no English translation whatsoever.  There is a lot of vocabulary but I found it to be totally random and useless because I was unable to use it to carry on a conversation.  I was not able to take a single thing I learned from the program and actually use it in a daily conversation or any conversation for that matter.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It was a huge disappointment and waste of money to me.
1617161063,5.0,Roseta uses different techniques - images, games etc to keep you learning and recaling words and phrases. Not the typical language methodologies.
1617161128,4.0,I'm about halfway through the program and I must say, Rosetta Stone is making the task of learning Vietnamese much more enjoyable and less daunting then I originally expected. However, there are 2 problems that have come to my attention early on which made me want to review this before completing the course. First, since the program is a full emersion program, while I am picking up on words and associations, I often find myself not understanding the entire phrase of what is being said. I wish there was an option to show the statements in English to just confirm what I thought was just shown to me.The other problem, however, I find worse. The microphone that comes with the program is terrible. First off, unless I'm doing something wrong the headset speakers doesn't work. All my sound came out of my computer speakers. Even more frustrating is that the mic rarely picks up what I am saying. I find myself saying phrases and words several times before the program acknowledges it. Then, it often doesn't register exactly what I said. I know Vietnamese is a tonal language, but I say the same thing without changing the pronunciation multiple times before the program says I'm correct. If I was pronouncing it wrong, then it should never say I did it correctly. If you're getting this program and your computer doesn't have a built in mic, I'd recommend buying one outside what comes in the box.In all, the program is great and I'm already starting to feel confident speaking to my girlfriend's family (who are Vietnamese) but I am not completely confident to carry entire conversations. Hopefully as I continue things will change.
1617161128,2.0,Having owned version 2 of Rosetta Stone Vietnamese, I was excited to try Rosetta Stone's new Version 4 TOTALe program.  Since they offered a trial or demo disk, I ordered a disk and tried it.  It seemed good and I liked all the improvements over version 2.  So I decided to buy the the program.  To Rosetta Stone's credit, this version is a giant step forward in interaction and variation of teaching methods to keep the Vietnamese student involved and interested.  The package includes a headphone & microphone set so you can speak the words you hear, and the computer will let you know if you're pronouncing the words and phrases correctly.  In fact, you can set the program's tolerance level of your pronounciation.  This new version also allows you to type in the words and phrases your hear, thereby helping you to learn how to spell the new language you are speaking.Unfortunately, in spite of all these new improvements, there were two problems (serious problems in my evaluation) that made me return the program for a refund.  The first problem was pronounciation.  Vietnamese is a tonal language; in fact, it has 6 different tones.  Also, there is a significant difference between the North Vietnamese dialect and the South Vietnamese dialect.  This program proportedly teaches the northern dialect, but the pronounciation is not correct.  In version 2, the pronounciation was textbook perfect; each tone was distinct and precise.  In version 4, they've gotten sloppy.  Specifically the high-rising tone used in some words (like con cho' [= dog], con ga'i [= girl], etc.) is pronounced  with a falling, rising tone (like pha?i [= yes] or ho?i [= question].  My wife, who is Vietnamese, confirmed these mispronounciations.The other problem is the method used to type in Vietnamese words.  When Vietnamese people type proper Vietnamese with tone marks, they usually use one of two methods: VIQR and VNI. (Look up these methods on the internet.)  But, Rosetta Stone doesn't use either of these common methods; instead have come up with their own method.  Unfortunately, it is very cumbersome and painfully slow.So, because of these 2 serious problems, I can't fully reccommend this program.  There are many other programs available that teach Vietnamese.  One I CAN recommend is called "A Little Vietnamese" by Griesser Software.  This program is unique in that it teaches both North and South Vietnamese dialects and the differences between them.  Unfortunately, it does not work on Macintosh computers, unless you have a Windows-simulator program (like Virtual PC or Parallels).  Rosetta Stone V4 will work on both Mac and Windows machines.
1617161128,2.0,I've been working on installing this thing now for SO LONG...it's so cumbersome.  It's not like modern software at all.I don't get it...even after giving it the license, it still churns FOREVER.  I don't know what it's doing...eating my pc alive?Why does it take so long to get to the training? I'll be dead of old age before i get there...
1620574128,5.0,Awesome quality, and when paired with the magnet pattern blocks, help with imagination, creativity and stretch your kid's learning. They were wonderful to use when my kids were stuck in the car on a long roadtrip.
1620574128,2.0,Would be better if they were laminated or something. Anotherbig  CON for me is that these do not use the squares that come in most of the 'shape sets'..I don't understand why not..you might wana shop around for a set of these that incorporates all the shapes in the set.
1620574128,5.0,I got this for the grandkids in particular the 6 year old but the 2 and 4 year old play with it also.  They love it.
1620574128,5.0,My kindergarten age son loves to use these with his wooden shapes to make designs and pictures.  He also likes creating on his own but these are very fun also.
1620574128,4.0,good I have two grand children that Iplan on useing this with they are young right now but they grow fast
183465193X,2.0,Very large and it looks pretty cheap.  It's also pretty difficult to see time in sunlight. It's unique, but it's not that great of a buy.
1848572972,2.0,This is a very short book that's great for an infant or very young toddler.  The pictures will catch the attention of your little one.  Naturally, they love that it makes sounds, but imagine my daughter's dismay when it stopped making the kissing sounds the day after she got it. And no, she's not one of those kids who sits there and incessantly pushes the buttons until the batteries run out immediately.  I got new batteries to replace it (takes 3 small calculator batteries), hoping it was just a problem with the batteries being old and replaced all three.  Guess what?  It worked for about 10 button presses and stopped again.  Since I had a large pack of the batteries, I did one more replacement when my daughter begged me to months later.  Same thing...a handful of button pushes and then nothing.  Now my daughter wants to throw the book in the trash.  I can hardly blame her.
1864502517,2.0,Sometimes, I think Lonely Planet has become so popular on the backpacking set that no one even questions its substance.When I was in Thailand, people referred to this as their &quot;Bible&quot;, an incredible overstatement.  It isn't that the information was wrong, just incomplete when it seemed to matter.I think there are other guidebooks that offer better information, even though budget travellers are made to believe it is the only series for them.  Shop around before you buy this.
1864502517,4.0,It's true Joe Cummings can speak Thai and there are many ways or writing Thai in English and it is true that many places he mentions do not have English signs but do not let that take away the fact that this book, given the size of he task, is well written and full of useful information. This book will get you around Thailand and help you discover places that most guidebooks don't even know about. OK the information may be out of date and as the prologue says, &quot;prices change&quot; but if you are visiting Thailand then buy this book and bring it with you. Sure you are going to see a lot of other people with the same book in places it talks about but that is called success not a point of derision?If you want bang up to date information such as no book can provide then the web is the place to be. inchiangmai.com is a great site about Chiangmai:-)Whichever way enjoy Thailand.DW
1864502517,3.0,Since 1987 I have been buying each new edition of the Lonely Planet Thailand travel guide. Back in the 1980s, this was the only worthwhile travel guide to Thailand, but Lonely Planet and Joe Cummings are clearly resting on their laurels. There is very little new material in each new edition that comes out every few years.  Now, in 2002, there are lots of new and betterguidebooks out there. I can recommend Insight Guides, Rough Guides, and DK travel guides, to name only a few good ones.Joe Cummings has been the main author of the Thailand TravelGuide for over two decades. He is also the author of many othertravel guidebooks published by Lonely Planet. The problem with his books is that he is not excited about travel, and this feeling comes through in his guidebooks. He is an expert on Asian art history, and I think that it would be more appropriate if he wrote books specifically about this subject, instead of travel guides for the general public.To get a good feeling about the kind of writer that Joe Cummings is, I would strongly recommend that you also read through the reviews of his Travel Guide to Laos, which is alsopublished by Lonely Planet.
1864502517,2.0,I agree with some of the other customer review that this &quot;guide&quot; is far from one of the best.  The information is sometimes wrong (unfortunately at the most inconvenient of times).  In addition the book is hardly a &quot;guide&quot;.  The walking tours, for example, give you little information and simply plop you at a site.  This is more of a handbook to accommpany a map.  The book seems to inspire the kind of tourism where one looks, but does not realy try to understand the culture around you. The worst part about this book is that it is not arranged well.  Each area you visit is arranged by &quot;activity&quot; like accommodation or food.  This is particularly annoying in the Bangkok section, where one has to constantly flip from section to section in order to figure out anything about where you are in the area of town you are visiting.  On the positive side, the recommendations of accomodation are decent.  Overall though, I recommend to get another guide.  Lonely planet has gone lazy.
1864502517,3.0,My friend and I took the Lonely planet and the Let's go travel book with us to Thailand.  We found Let's go a lot easier to use.  Lonely planets' index was useless causing time wasted while hunting through the book looking for info.  Let's Go Thailand had better maps and was easier to follow all around.
1864502517,5.0,I had the 8th edition in my first travel, and I couldn't avoid to but he 9th for my last travel to thailand. A very updated and complete guide that leads you to one of the most marvellous countries of the SEA. Story, geography, warnings, food information and even a quick guide to the red-district of bkk. Another LP success.
1864502517,4.0,Lonely Planet Thailand has just about everything you need to know about Thailand, and then some.  A great book if you plan on living, visiting, or just learning about Thailand.  It is limited on the pictures, but makes up for being the book having the most information on Thailand that I have had the chance to read.  I used this book frequently and carried it with me everywhere, but it was no match to me and the harsh heat of Thailand.  The book's binding glue gave, and I was left with sections falling out and a pretty cover.  I still use it though, because of its tons of information!
1864502517,5.0,I recently completed a trip through India, Nepal, Thailand and China, and used Lonely Planet guides for all four countries. They all had their ups and downs, but I thought the Thailand one was the best, by far. First it was the most accurate, that is the info was closest to what I actually encounted while travelling around. And second it had the most evocative and confident prose. One could really sense the authors' strong affinity for the country. Like another reviewer wrote, Cummings doesn't talk down to his readers yet he doesn't pander either.I felt very much as if I had my own personal guide leading the way with the Thailand book. The other three seemed more like  compendia of information gathered without regard to any central zeitgeist.The Pattaya reviewers must have tourist businesses in that city! The authors seemed very even-handed in their treatment of the city nonethess. Furthermore 12 pages on any destination seems plenty to me, however, so I don't understand tte complaint.I also used LP's Thai Phrasebook and found it very useful.
1864502517,5.0,Thank you so much for this product. It was a great price, and everything was perfect. Looked almost new. Hope to due business again!!!:)
1864502517,4.0,Some of these reviewers work for other guidebooks; these guys are pretty unscrupulous, as their guidebooks reveal.Joe Cummings wrote the Lonely Planet guides to Thailand, Myanmar (Burma) and Laos. His insight into the societies and politics is unsurpassed, and I recommend his guidebooks for that reason alone. (Sometimes LP authors are a little condescending; Joe is not at all. This is important to me.) However, I had the old guide and I recommend you get this newer one (it came out while I was gone).I didn't give it five stars just because, for Christ's sake, it's a guidebook, not War and Peace.
1906726205,3.0,Not very permant press. When it comes out of the wash, it still needs ironing. Guess I need to find a more expensive handkerchief as I do not iron.
1906726205,1.0,This item was supposed to be permanent press and was not.  It came out so wrinkled you couldn't even use it.I pressed it with my iron and it wrinkled badly when my husband tried to use it.  We threw the handkerchiefs away.
1906726205,5.0,They are large, no ironing, no shrinking. They are durable and well made. I didn't buy them here but they are the same ones.
1933027223,5.0,Although I have knit for a while, I am a beginner afghan-maker and this book has been wonderful.  The directions are clear and the pictures are beautiful.
1933027223,5.0,I love the ideas in this book
1933027223,5.0,This  eautiful book is a source of delight. I cannot wait to get started, but force myself to finish other projects first!
1933027223,5.0,I'm a dyed in the wool afghan knitter and I love knitting cables and knitting color.  That's what this book is all about.  It is definitely not an afghan book for the beginning knitter but if you have gotten the essentials of knitting under your belt, this book has beautiful patterns to try.There is a wonderful intarsia section with the possibility of all kinds of adaptations.  These quilts would be especially wonderful for that child (or inner child) in your life.My favorite section is the cable/aran section.  I drool over the afghans here especially Diamond Drapes.  My favorite color afghan is the Mudcloth one.  Having travelled to Africa, this afghan brings back wonderful memories.I am also an avid lace knitter and I think that the Diamond Lace afghan is extraordinarily beautiful and feminine.  I can't wait to knit it.I applaud Ms. Epstein on not using charts except for intarsia for which they are essential.  I hate charts.  I love that her patterns are written out line by line.  For knitters like me, it makes the difference between buying a book or leaving it on the shelf.
1933027223,5.0,Hats off to Nicky Epstein - or should I say covers off!  This book is phenomenal.  I collect knitting books and there are not many amongst the recent onslaught of books that I find add anything to the science and art of knitting.  Nicky's books do.  All of them in general and this one in particular are fantastic.  She has a style and sense of color that is inspiring.  Note: not all of the designs are new.  I believe that at least one was in an issue of Vogue Knitting in the mid 90's.  I do not consider that a minus.  It is great to have all of her designs in one place so I don't have to tear up my magazine stash trying to find that one elusive issue.
1933027223,5.0,I am a novice knitter always in search of unique afghan patterns - this book has many.  The book itself is very well laid out with beautiful photographs.  The only negative thing I can is that the patterns are extremely labor intensive and require the utmost concentration.  I am looking forward to starting one of the afghans when I have the time to set aside for such an in-depth project.  All in all well worth the money.
1933027223,5.0,I understand that several reviewers have complaints that there is quite a bit of repetition here, but that's not a problem if you don't have the previous appearances of the afghans, as I do not. I see lots of Nicky Epstein's work style here. A great deal of color work, some delicate and some brighter. Some texture. In all quite a bit of variety, with great production values for the book itself.I would not recommend this for the beginner, unless you are really adventurous, or planning ahead to be an expert. There is little here to start off a new knitter safely. I would gather some good basic techniques and ensure that you don't have lots of bad habits first, before trying to tackle most of these.Some of the colorwork that looks really intimidating is simply duplicate stitch, so it's not nearly so difficult to  produce, but has impressive results. There are a couple of afghans here that would give me pause before tackling them, and I LIKE a challenge, so be warned.However, I think this is a fine book if you don't have lots of her other work in your collection. I had never seen any of these before, so I'm really pleased.I would caveat, though, that in my experience of working with her patterns before, to be really alert for what is on your needles v what is in the pattern. If in doubt, go with your needles. Also, I have nearly always found that she seems to prefer a much lighter fabric than I do, so I gauge down by at least 2 sizes, sometimes 3. If in doubt, gauge, gauge, gauge
1933027223,5.0,Great book with many excellent, creative designs.  I was never really into knitting afghans, seemed to repetitive but this book has changed my mind and I'm casting on my afghan soon!Lots of variety with color knitting, lace, and cables.  Easy to read charts. Glad I came across this book.
1933027223,5.0,Inspiring - for the advanced knitter.  A wonderful book, beautifully photographed.  Nicky Epstein encourages me to break free, expand my skills and try something new.
1933027223,5.0,Another fantastic book by Nicki.  As always her designs are brilliant and exciting. Would love to knit all of the designs in this edition!
1933027223,4.0,This is a good knitting book, with some very detailed and beautiful graphic designs on the afghans.  I was just surprised that they were all in stockinette stitch (intarsia color knitting). I was expecting some variety in the type of stitch patterns.  BUT, if you love doing intarsia color knitting, this is the one for you.
1933027223,4.0,Nicky Epstein's afghans are works of art. Recent knitting  trends  present quick and easy projects which are usually uninspired.  Her patterns require more time, but the end result is  heirloom-quality, one-of-a-kind beauty that is timeless. The book itself is beautifully done, and it is a pleasure to curl up and dream of beginning your next project.
1933027223,5.0,This book is simply scrumptious and inspiring.  Some of the best things are the full-page photographs of the afghans with no artsy staging or lighting, so you can really see what they look like.
1933027223,4.0,This book is beautifully presented, it's a work of art in it's own right. These afghans are for the serious knitter who's prepared to spend big bucks on their heirlooms. Having said that, the designs are quite spectacular and would be a challenge and a joy to knit. A friend commented that some of them looked a bit like they had been made on a knitting machine, which is true. Most of these designs are great, and the ones that aren't so great can easily be modified so they don't look quite so fussy. This is a lovely book, though for most of us it's a 'one day I'll make one' book.
1933027223,3.0,This is a beautiful book.  The pictures are gorgeous and the assortment of afghans is lovely.  I was disappointed in how few patterns are really new!  Most of them have been published in a previous book by the same designer, "Knitting for Your Home".  The "from her personal collection" reference in the title misled me to believe these were previously unpublished patterns.  But if you don't have a large collection of knitting books already, this one is beautiful.
1935159100,5.0,Bought this for a neighbor girl who got accepted to the University of Alabama, she had a great time with it and it showed her just where everything was going to be when she goes in August...........great idea............
1983049581,3.0,Most of the butterflies fell off within the first week so I had 2 stop wearing it. Pretty disappointed indeed
2049768915,2.0,this watch was kinda of broken when i got it and it didnt really work and i tried to return it and it didnt really work other then that i loved it
2200483236,4.0,If you are looking for something to please the crowd, this is it. Very nice bag for its price. Strong canvas material. The leather looking materials are actually synthetic or pleather. Its good for summer time and goes perfectly with linen suit. The zipper is ok but could be better and stronger. I used it for a whole summer and still shining. I have bags that cost over $ 400 each. But If I compare the value this one has more value than them. Superb Product.
2258798612,5.0,I like the military style and this bag really came to my taste. This bag made with very dense material, a lot of pockets and very comfortable strap that does not curl on shoulder.
2394869135,5.0,We purchased this watch for its beauty and cost. Very good quality. this was a gift for our grandson who loves trains. You can see the face of the watch as it is open at the top. Push the winder and it opens showing a full clear face of the watch. Cannot complain about the cost but the shipping was high. All in all, a good product for the price.Additional Information: After having the watch for some time now and still working and running smoothly, I still agree that this watch as a gift for someone else or just to purchase for yourself, you won't go wrong. Great product.
245600258X,5.0,This shirt fit true to form for an XXL person.  Look nice and was of decent quality. husband was pleased with it as it was for a work Hawaiian theme party!
245600258X,5.0,Vivid colors, fabric feels good, and the fit is excellent. Price was right and I got it in 2 days, just in time for a luau themed dance!
245600258X,5.0,Great shirt!  Will be wearing on my upcoming cruise!If you are looking for a comfortable, standout shirt, this is the one for you!
245600258X,5.0,my husband loved the shirt. material is great. we are leaving on a cruise to the bahamas soon. will be great to wear on the cruise
245600258X,3.0,The XXL shirt came in a very small envelope which at first made us wonder if it was a child's size.  After getting it open realized it's just very thin fabric.  Not the best value.  Because this was specifically ordered to wear at a party (semi costume style) it worked perfectly.  The colors are just as vivid and bright as shown in the picture.  Not sure how it will hold up through washings and wearings but we'll keep it for special occasions and enjoy it while it lasts!
245600258X,5.0,Fits really nice and i get lots of compliments on it. The company I work for decided to make friday's &#34;Hawaiian Shirt Friday&#34; and this shirt was perfect!.
245600258X,5.0,The fit was very true to size. Very roomy and comfortable. The material is incredibly soft to touch and has no rough or itchy spots on the lining. The shirts breathes very well and perfect for Houston weather which is both hot and humid.I received many compliments on the colors which are as vibrant as pictured.
245600258X,3.0,That summer I wore all these bright shirts. Loud colors, waves, palm trees, but no man should be an island. The kind of shirt that begged to be noticed. I for one, did not want to be noticed. In fact, that summer I very actively sought to not be seen. I would lay about the house in my faux-hawaiian shirt waiting for phone calls I wouldn't pick up. Some time passed before I realized I hadn't changed out of it. When I took it off I was invisible to even myself.
245600258X,4.0,its bright, loud and perfect.  just what a Hawaiian shirt should be.Material is less than stellar.  If you is expecting a cotton or slik style shirt, not so much.. But the make, style and print all looks great.Will see how it holds up..
245600258X,3.0,The Hawaiian printed shirt for men worked for the purpose for which it was ordered. The fit was as expected.
245600258X,3.0,But it was a XXL and it came too wide for me.  I had it taken in and now it fits fine.
245600258X,3.0,Shirt is great but I just wish I had known that the sizes run about 1 size larger than normal.
245600258X,4.0,It wasn't expensive so I wasn't expecting much.  Since most shirts of this price are cut small, I ordered a larger size than normal.  This shirt appears to run large because not only did I have enough room, I was swimming in it!  I'll never get lost on a beach!Thanks
245600258X,5.0,OK when this arrived in the package I thought there is no way it will fit me.... then I opened it to find the material was very fine and light.  Fit perfectly, great for warm weather and looks like it cost twice as much as it did.
245600258X,5.0,just what I had expected on the basis of past purchases. The sizings have always been consistent. Very comfortable shirts
245600258X,1.0,it's like a square when you hold it up. nice material tho, and bright arresting color. just not for tall people.
245600258X,5.0,Fit well was light and Airy and has held up to a coupel of washings without bleeding or threading out.
245600258X,5.0,I like to wear comfortable Hawaiian shirts, and this one is a perfect addition to my collection. Fits well, seems to be good quality, good stitching, love the colors. I'm very happy with it.
245600258X,4.0,I love the feel of the fabric.  Has a satin-like feel to it, and is very light.  But of all the shirts, I've purchased, this one is really big!  Not all sizes are the same, and will need to keep an eye on the size charts when I buy again.  Will purchase from this company again.
245600258X,5.0,I was a little large, but i was more concerned about when it would arrive. It arrived the next day, faster then what was expected. I was pleased with the look, but the fit was a little large.
245600258X,5.0,Nice, cheap-ish, light, rayon (or something akin) shirt. Great for the second, sunburned day at the beach!
245600258X,5.0,this shirt looks and feels like a vacation hawaiian shirt. Very fun to wear. Looks and fits as it should.
245600258X,5.0,Love, love, love, the color of this shirt and the feel of it is awesome. I got it in a 2x and it is nice and loose. I will order from this company again. Very pleased with how fast it shipped.
245600258X,5.0,bought this as a gift.  very soft fabric, and fit as expected. also it was delivered very quickly. i was very pleased with the service.
245600258X,4.0,Colors are as vivid as in the pics. Pattern runs through.  Fabric is some silky Nylon, Polyester or Polyamide. Label says 100% Terivoile, whatever that is, probably modal. I bought the orange island native one & the blue one that had Cozumel on it in the photo, hoping to get the Cozumel pattern, but it doesn't have that on it.  The sizing chart is pretty true.  A lot of folks here have complained about oversizing of the LaLeela shirts.  I have a fabric tape measure and was able to measure one of my existing voluminous shirts against the dimensions given in the chart and ordered that size.  The belly, shoulders and airyness are just right, although the length doesn't seem to come down as far as mentioned on the chart as compared with one of my existing shirts.  Overall, the measure was real close to the chart given.  So if you wear XXL shirts like I do, then just get XL in the LaLeela, it should be right unless you want super airyness, then order your regular size and the shirt will be huge.  Overall, very nice and modestly airy airy at XL size, should work well for my trip to Cozumel.  I go there about once every two years, so I'm used to the humidity of the island and the lighter the fabric, the better.  Breezes can get a little coolish in the evening and things have a hard time drying there, so the less cotton clothing, the better.  This shirt should fill the bill.
245600258X,5.0,Great shirt for the price !!!
245600258X,5.0,fit as expected, perfect for the cruise my wife & I went on....everyone complements it....came fast & on time in perfect condition...
245600258X,4.0,Bought this for a friend who was retiring from a lifetime of suits, offices, and stuffy meetings in a cold northern city.  He loved it.  Good quality for the price and it arrived very quickly.
245600258X,5.0,I don't know how it fits, as I bought it as a gift. It should be okay. I wanted bright and colorful, a &#34;good times&#34; shirt, and I think that's just what I got.
245600258X,4.0,It looks good and it feels good.  Bright colors, beautiful pattern. It is a nice shirt to wear, thanks and aloha
245600258X,5.0,Going to a Luau and probably only wear it this one time.  Great value and great fit.  Would order again
245600258X,5.0,I pre-read some of the previous reviews, which said the sizing was generous.  I was NOT dissappointed. The shirt fits fine with plenty of breathing room. This seller can definately be trusted!
245600258X,5.0,Love the shirts! Ordered two shirts, and I am not disappointed! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a comfortable shirt!
245600258X,4.0,It is a very pretty shirt, material is thin. But for what I need it for it is perfect.  I have a feeling once washed it will require major ironing.
245600258X,4.0,I'm a XXl...haven't gotten bigger in20 years...yet XXl seems to have changed,..so I end up ordering larger and larger...this actually fit.
245600258X,3.0,Beautiful material but I expected a 4x and got a shirt that fits more like an 8x. Too bad because it is a beautiful material.
245600258X,4.0,This shirt has a very nice fabric, breathable and fits well.  The color is really vibrant as well.  I'm glad I bought it.
245600258X,4.0,It is a really nice make, overall fit, and material but it is just a bit long in the torso
245600258X,5.0,My husband is tickled pink with this purchase.  The colors are vibrant, the fit is loose and the fabric is THIN, SOFT and AIRY.  It's not a heavy cotton, it's perfect for summer wear.  Definitely recommend this shirt!
245687787X,1.0,I sent this mess back! Looked good on the picture, but don't be fooled. It's small, the strap is thin and it's big enough to hold a wallet and some make up. Dude...seriously, if you're thinking about getting this for your laptop, you will be disappointed. There is no cushion or protection for your electronics. Just.....purse. Good customer service though. They refunded me promptly.
245687787X,2.0,Looks good on the outside but basically useless as bag can barely fit anything: so narrow if you're carrying anything but a one inch thick book, you're out of luck!!!
2485907463,5.0,The watch is very sporting. It can be used for almost any casual affair and for daily dress. For those of us whose vision is changing, it is very easy to see the numbers with no problems. It is also very sporting for others as well. the price is very good.
3293015344,5.0,This bracelet was exactly what was pictured and I loved it!  I've received numerous compliments on it already.  It was an amazing find!
3293015344,3.0,I was not sure how to rate this, as it is truly a beautiful bracelet. The individual pieces are gorgeous and the pictures are stunning. Did not feel cheap. However, as the recipient of this gift placed it on their wrist for the FIRST time....the top &#34;string&#34; (a stretchy plastic rubber band) busted:( And it was a small female wrist. So while the bracelet initially exceeded my expectations, I am now left with a few pretty tiles that cannot be worn and I feel like a crummy gift giver.
3924862206,4.0,Good summary of the unarmed techniques from Kukishinden Ryu.  Well illustrated and very clear.  As with all martial arts reference books, remember that you need an instructor who has studied the school, as there is much more to know than could possibly be contained in a book.I wish that the book contained weapons forms from the school.
3924862206,4.0,This book has alot of techniques and gata, it is not a true "densho" as only SOke has those but, it is a good refernce.
3924862206,5.0,As with the other ryu-ha books from Tengu, the illustrations are a solid reference for those who have had or are currently engaged in training in the Bujinkan.
3924862206,5.0,Great densho and beautifully bound. Easy to read and understand with many katas, training materials, pictures etc...I am proud to add it to my collection.I recommend this densho to all who seek to learn and understand the bujinkan art.
3987538945,5.0,great watch! self winding and is just awesome! love it! I have gotten more compliments on this watch then the rose gold rudiger I just bought
3987538945,3.0,i had gotten this as a gift for a friend it worked for the first two weeks and now has to be set for the correct time a few times a day and he is not to happy about it and nor am i
3999837810,4.0,The pants are slightly stiff probably because they're brand new, but they look sexy and authentic. As I was told aniline is quite a smelly chemical for leather dying. By the time I got them they still smell a bit but not that terrible or pungent. The fitting is good and true, but these pants are not for guy with even slightly fatty belly or you should order them one size larger. Otherwise they can tighten your waist and crotch quite much when you move around or sit in them.The only thing I'm really not happy with is actually the shipping. The DHL tracking number I was given was practically useless. I never know where my package was during the shipping. Nonetheless I got my trousers few days earlier than the earliest expected date of arrival (over 2 weeks).
3999837810,5.0,Sizing is always a problem, I'm somewhere between 30 and 32, these pants fit perfect (size 31), though too long, I knew i'd have to hem them anyway. The quality is top of the line, really comfortable. The delivery date window was about 3 to 6 weeks (they come from Germany) They showed up in about 5 days. If you're looking for leather jeans and don't want to order, try on, ship back over and over again, go to these guys. thier sizes are true. Highly recommended.
3999838167,5.0,These are beautifully styled leather jeans.  BUT, they do run small.  I wear a 34 waist normally, but I had to exchange the first pair because I couldn't even get the button at the waist closed, let alone the zipper.  It's great that this style comes in a 36&#34; inseam, though, and I gotta say that once I received the second pair, it was worth the long wait -- the new pair fits like they were made for me, and the soft, brown leather is very comfortable.  But I repeat, men, if you wear a 34&#34; waist and your jeans are snug in that size, buy this style two inches larger. I should add here that this company made it easy to exchange for another size. I am a happy customer!
3999847743,5.0,These are beautifully styled leather jeans.  BUT, they do run small.  I wear a 34 waist normally, but I had to exchange the first pair because I couldn't even get the button at the waist closed, let alone the zipper.  They are also very tight in the leg, and I'm pretty skinny.  But it's great that this style comes in a 36&#34; inseam, and I gotta say that once I received the second pair, it was worth the long wait -- the new pair fits like they were made for me!  So, men, if you wear a 34&#34; waist and your jeans are snug in that size, buy this style two inches larger. I should add here that this company made it easy to exchange for another size. I am a happy customer!
4759817492,5.0,I use to this pocket watch for work. i work in a warehouse so it goes through a lot. it keeps time very well also looks pretty sweet  it has a glass cover but the face of the watch is plastic and it sometimes pops out when you open it but there is really no need to open it the front cover is also magnified but over all its a great buy and a really awesome watch and great for the price
481713996X,2.0,was not a us 34  i am returning the pants the sizing is not correlated with us measurements  it may be onerous to return to germany  is there a us location?
4911850813,1.0,I've had it for a about 2 years...then just like the earlier reviews, the band just broke and came loose. It's not the band that needs replacement, it's the whole assembly where the band hooks up. I've asked some watch stores and it's gonna be costly to have it repaired. Just a sad end, to an otherwise very functional time piece.
4911850813,1.0,The Casio SPF-60 was a gift from my children.  It did an OK job of providing barometric data and altitude and depth.  However, the casing was not well made. The band separated from the casing one day while I was eating dinner.  The store at which it was purchased sent it to Casio on our behalf.  Casio called to advise that the watch arrived at their facility more than a year after purchase and therefore was not covered by the warranty.  They offered to replace the casing that had failed for a charge of $67.00.  A lot to pay for a watch that a company will not stand behind.Casio was technically correct. If you do not expect more than a year from a $200 watch, then this is a fun time peice.  If you want something that will last more than a year, I recommend you look to another manufacturer.
4911850813,2.0,After using my Sea Pathfinder Casio for about 1.5 years the band just broke without any special cause.  After taking it apart, it appears that the actual case broke and not the band.  It is impossible to simply replace the band.  I would need a new section of the case to replace the plastic piece that broke.  A disappointing end to a watch that otherwise performed well.  Apparently this is a reoccuring failure mode for this watch and one for which potential buyers should be aware.
4911850813,2.0,I enjoyed the features inclduing altitude, temperature and barometer.  Worked fine for over one year.  The problem I had is that the housing around the bezel broke.  I thought it was the band and ordered a replacement.  Took it in to a watch repair store and they said this was not the first one they saw that the housing broke away.Too bad the quality did not match the features.
4911850813,5.0,I purchased this watch in 2005. It is still working. I have not replaced anything on the watch. Not even the battery. I'm wondering if the problems mentioned by the other reviewers came after I made my purchase. Quality control seems to be the very first thing to go when company's are looking for ways to cut costs. My watch has taken quite a beating over the years. It still works just fine, and the measurements are pretty darn close to "reality" when I check their operation. Now I'm afraid about finding a replacement if this product is no longer available.
4911850813,1.0,Anyone who rates this high just hasn't had the band break yet.  I had mine since May 2005 and it is an awesome watch.  I couldn't have wanted more.  I took it everywhere.  While walking down a hall at work the band separated from the watch housing.  End of watch.  Repair estimate was $60 plus shipping, etc.  Only a 90 day warranty on the new band.
4971850491,5.0,I like to have my bearings when I travel. The compass function on this watch works great for that. The solar recharging assures not having to worry about battery replacement. Although big, the titanium makes it very lightweight and it is very comfortable.The only negatives are the thickness and the fact that body temperature affects the built-in thermometer. For accurate readings, the owner's manual reccommends removing the watch and keeping it out of direct sunlight for 30 minutes.For the price, you absolutely cannot beat this watch.
4971850491,5.0,I was inpressed with the fast shippment.
4971850491,5.0,I have been very pleased with the Pathfinder watch by Casio.  It is well worth the money.  I find it pretty incredible that they can put so many features in one package.  I use the compass frequently as we are in Costa Rica and I need a reference for our travels.  I use the 5 alarms and the timer frequently (every day).  The automatic nightlight feature is very useful.  I have not used the depthfinder as of yet, but will soon as I begin scuba diving classes next week.  The solar cell that recharges the battery automatically is incredible technology.  The watch is incredible.
4971850491,5.0,It's a beauty of watch.  Solar COOL.  it's tough to set the real tempeture, it is realy BIG but is very confortable and lightweight. I'm so happy with it. The Titanium stuff looks indestructible. buy it from amazon the price is way low crazy, don't even think about it. buy It
4971850491,4.0,This watch was far cheaper on amazon then any other supplier.Gives great service and so far is indestructible.Sea sand, mud no problem.Some of the functions remain unused ( the watch is smarter then the user)But Time, Compass, and date all work great.Only negative is the barometer the symbols are so small you need really good eyesight.
4971850491,5.0,Last year I bought a Casio Triple Sensor Pathfinder. It has a hard black case and tough resin band for durability like the Casio G-Shock.  I have owned a series of G Shocks over the past twenty years and I believe they are the best activity watches made at an affordable price.  I love this Titanium Pathfinder because it does so many things well and has an equally impressive appearance. The Titanium Pathfinder functions in a very similar manner to my original one, with some additional timers for yacht racing.  The main reason I bought this watch was my desire to own a good quality all metal Triple Sensor Pathfinder.  I was stunned to find this one on Amazon and at a price which was lower than I paid for the first one.  I became immediately interested because the components (case and wristband) are Titanium.  Titanium is the hottest metal going for all types of consumer goods including watches and appliances (like my refrigerator).  Another new feature for me was the solar powered movement.  My only disappointment is that it doesn't include atomic timekeeping; however the error tolerance (+ or - 15 seconds/month) is the same for the atomic Pathfinder and the solar Pathfinder.  I believe Casio now makes a solar powered atomic Pathfinder but it is considerably more expensive.  It appears that this model is being discontinued so you need to act quickly.  I am sure its replacement will be considerably more costly.
4971850491,5.0,No worries concerning the order or shipment.  I'm a big built guy so it fits just fine, but it is a pretty big watch if you're small framed.  I don't use all the functions much, but they're nice when you want to know.  Indoors the compass is hit and miss but outdoors it does well.  Haven't tested the depth meter yet, but I have a dive computer for that anyway.  If you have a need (or want) for it's functions, it's a nice watch.  I'd buy it again.
4971850491,5.0,The Casio Pathfinder SPF70-T Multi-Gauge Titanium is one of my three favorite watches, next to my Seiko Black Monster and Citizen Skyhawk Flight Chronograph Eco-Drive. Why? The common denominators of these three models, amindst my collection of other Japanese and Swiss makes, are durability and reliability. I also want to point out that the Pathfinder is my "beater watch" which I use whenever I play extended rounds of rugby, soccer, hoops, motocross, or some mountain trailing. Somehow, wearing this watch while engaging in these activities induces similar effects produced by smoking a cigarette -- calms you down when youre stressed, and pumps some pep when youre down. Of course, I stopped smoking long ago and thats why I can join in in all sorts of physical fun and can reward myself with this ultra-functional and super-strong wrist instrument, the price of which is only the equivalent of 30 packs of cigarettes.
4971850491,5.0,I LIVE IN GREECE...I WAS IMPRESSED ALSO WITH FAST SHIPMENT..THE WACH ALTHOUGH ITS RATHER BIG, IT HAS TONES OF FEAUTURES AND ITS A SAILING TOOL...NICE JOB GUYS IN AMAZON AND IN Digitalwrist.I WILL RECOMEND YOU asap!!!THANX AGAIN...ALKIS
4971850491,4.0,This is a great watch and is loaded with features that an outdoor person like myself desires to have in a watch.  The only negative feature is that the watch is very large and I have received several comments about the size of the watch.
4971850788,5.0,And I'm just going to offer my support for just an amazing time piece.  Not only it this watch attractive to look at, the combination of it's light weight performance, features including solar powered interface, and rugged design, make this time piece a cut above.  I love my PRG60T, and I'm waiting to see what they come up with for the next generation.
4971850788,5.0,This review is about PRG60T-7V, the analog-digital (ana-digi) Solar Casio Triple Sensor Pathfinder Protrek watch.  Some reviews listed under this item are about different Pathfinder Protrek watches without the analog hands which I never seriously considered.  Analog dials have a great advantage - you can take a split-second glimpse and still know what time it is, and combined with digital dials they give you an abundance of available readings.  I have been looking for and buying only ana-digi watches like this because of their functionality and flexibility.The greatest selling point of this watch is the perfect combination of features that I am always looking for (listed in order of importance):- Analog-digital multi-function watch- Solar- Shock-resistant- Compass- Barometer- AltimeterSo far, I have been very proudly using this watch every day for two and a half years and it is still my #1 functionality-features watch in the world.  Although it's not listed as anti-shock but as "Tough Solar" it really is a very tough engineering work of art.  It still works perfectly even though it has gone through a significant number of abusing events.  Besides the annual vacation swims/dives in the sea and everyday normal movements, I'm an ex professional drummer who still frequently pats his knees in the rhythm of the music, and nowadays this watch has to withstand frequent clapping when listening to the music and playig with my daughter.  In addition, my 1.5 year old daughter used to play with it occasionally and she let it fall on the floor many times.  Moreover, this watch has two times received a hit that would have broken apart any other watch I have.  Once I accidentally hit a corner of a rock wall with it so hard that my hand hurt.  In spite of my expectations, all those abuses have only left a single barely visible scratch in the middle of the glass and several minor scratches on the bezel, so I can testify that the crystal/glass on it is very scratch resistant and the watch really is very tough.  I bought the titanium model/bracelet, so the entire watch is very light in spite of its size.The solar charging works great and the battery is almost always on H (high) position, and only in December during long nights and short days it sometimes goes to M (medium) and the contributing factor might be that I have the automatic backlight set up and it frequently lights up even when I don't need it.  When I get the M reading I can quickly charge the watch if I leave it in the window for half an hour during a sunny day because in the winter it is often covered with my sleeve when I'm outside.  Usually, instead of charging I like to push the envelope and see whether I can get it to L (low), but I've never seen that so far. At night and during prolonged low light conditions, the watch shuts off its digital displays to save power, but once you move the watch (or turn the backlight on), they turn on automatically and instantaneously.Some people complain about inaccurate temperature readings on watches like this, but you have to be aware that there is no way your watch will not get influenced by your body temperature, so you need to take it off and leave it for several minutes before you can get an accurate reading.  The only exception is when you are swimming/diving and you can obtain a reasonably accurate measurement of the water temperature in a matter of minutes without taking the watch off, especially if you are moving your arms and swimming or if water is otherwise flowing around the watch.The barometer/altimeter is accurate (of course, if you adjust it prior to your trip to a known reference point).  I always watch it on the airplane where you can tell which passenger plane keeps the air pressure best (or also which company is trying to save and scrape on air supplies and maintain low pressure)  - sometime you'll see the pressure drop about 33% before they adjust it and so the reading of the altimeter in a pressurized plane cabin is not at all accurate.  The internal artificial pressure they keep in the passenger cabin usually corresponds to 4000-6500 feet above the sea level.The compass function works well, but I think they should have allowed it to work for a longer and possibly adjustable period of time before shutting itself off automatically after 20 seconds.  I know it takes a considerable amount of battery power to run the compass but still, I'd like to have the option to run it for 30 seconds or a minute without having to press the button repeatedly.There is more I'd like to see and buy in a better watch and I have been looking for it for years, but I still haven't seen one as good as this.The only two main competitors I considered for a while were Tissot's T-Touch and Citizen's Eco-Drive Skyhawk.  The T-Touch watch, as seen in the James Bond movie is a bit less bulky and more dressy, so it looks better, but you have to spend about double the amount on it.  Still, if it were solar I wouldn't hesitate to buy it, but since it's not, in my referent system that translates to a waste of time and money when the battery runs out and a questionable water resistance after replacement, so it's out of the question.  Citizen's similar solar bulky watch Eco-Drive Skyhawk is a bit more dressy, but its digital and analog dials are not independent and from some reviews I can also conclude that it's definitely not as tough and resistant as this one.  Omega had an amazing ana-digi multi-function Speedmaster X-33 watch that was a serious candidate for my favorite, however, that one was not solar powered, it was many times more expensive, and it is not being made any more, so Casio's PRG60T-7V still owns the "THE WATCH" title in my world.Some minor cons:- I'm 6'3" and not skinny, and although together with the titanium bracelet it does have a rugged sturdy look, I'd like it to be a bit smaller, and definitely thinner.- Position of start/stop/reset buttons on the stop watch function is unusual.  The lower right button is used to start and stop and the upper right is used to reset (I'm used to the opposite).- The color of the first circular layer under the bezel (I suppose this is the solar charging part) is gray but in some light it gets an ugly-ish  purple shade- It takes a long time to circle almost 12 hours if your watch is one minute fast because I can only adjust the hands forward.  Fortunately, the watch is pretty accurate and I only do this several times a year, two  times because of the DST switch.Things I would like to see in a future improved model:- Atomic world-wide time adjustments- Count down timer.All in all, this is as good as it gets. I have been searching for a better watch for years, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
4971850788,5.0,Es un maravilla de reloj, un poco grande en tama&ntilde;o, pero esta padrisimo. El extensible es muy comodo y tiene opcion de ajustar el tama&ntilde;o aun sin quitar eslabones del reloj. llevo mas de un a&ntilde;o con el y ningun problema. Aunque tiene muchas funciones que no son imprescindibles en un reloj, debo de reconocer que nunca esta de mas una brujula por que siempre la ocupas cuando menos lo imaginas.
4971850788,4.0,I have the watch for 3 years now, and am very satisfied. It was quite a challenge though to get the 'lunitidal interval' value needed to display the correct tidal data. The manual lists the required numbers for several cities around the world, but tidal dynamics are extremely complicated and tides can differ several hours even when you go up north or south of the same coast. What made it more complicated, was that I am living in a country where English is not the main language, and I had no idea what I was looking for in local terms. Finally, I understood that lunitidal interval is known here as "gemiddeld havengetal" (Dutch), but still it was a real challenge to find it for the spot of coast I was planning to use the watch. It was not on the internet - ultimaltely I was able to find it in a specialized yearly nautical publication. I can imagine that not being able to find the right data, might let some users down. Casio should have realized this and should have put more effort into guiding the user to the right values. It might be the reason Casio left this option out of the newer Sea-Patchfinder models. For users in The Netherlands: I have uploaded a table at [...]As far as the watch: one problem I have with it, is that it does not have dual time, which I really need. Second, I do not understand why Casio has chosen not to print a complete 360 degree scale around the watch, but chose to print COMP, BARO and START in between the 210 and 330 degree values instead. Especially since it is also shown near the buttons as well as on the display at about the same spot. OK, it is nice to have a compass and a barometre, but don't need to read THREE times every time I look at my watch. Another disadvantage is that it is impossible to verify that the watch is level when using the compass. Especially at sea, this is essential. The watch does have some sort of tilt sensor to automatically switch on the light when you look at your wrist - it would have been nice if this feature had been used to indicate if the watch was level.A small disadvantage is the short lighting period. Having so many batteries aboard, this period could have been longer than 1.5 seconds. Also, it would have been nice if the moon graph was inverted - with the positive display showing the lighted part of the moon. Standing outside in the dark and pressing the light switch, results in seeing the dark part of the moon lighted up on your watch... Also, a button lock would have been nice. Because of its size, it is easy to press a button by mistake. Especially the Baro-button is prone to be pressed inadvertially when bending your wrist, supporting yourself during an activity.Otherwise, a perfect watch, which is extremely light for its size. The distinct beep when you return to time mode, is very handy. The glass does not scratch, it is perfectly protected by the bezel ring. I am looking for a replacement after 3 years, since the black plastic light switch broke off (it is only supported at the back by a small metal pin which is off-center, so pressing it eventually makes the connection snap) and the barometric pressure sensor went offline recently. Since I really need dual time and I do not like the newer Pathfinder model using about 1/4 of the display telling me about the battery status (what a waste of space!), I decided to compromise the tidal data and buy a Suunto watch (with button lock and sensor that indicates if the compass is level) next.
4971850788,5.0,Bigger than my Timex watch, but not as heavy. Easy to use. Excellent price. Auto light is great. Compass, altimeter, barometer, and thermometer work just fine. This watch is technological state of the art. Check it out!
4971850788,4.0,this is an amazing watch its like having my own weather station on my wrist and its tought.its also quite entertaining using it while mountain biking. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the sound of the alarm its not that loud that sometimes i can't hear it. considering the size of it its amazingly light. so thats how titanium feels like. and amazon.com/digitalwrist delivery is reliable got the watch within 2 working days.
4971850813,1.0,I bought this model last month; was excited about the "triple sensor" features. It is a let down! It's basically good for just telling time.The compass settings were off; had to be recalibrated manually.The barometer readings don't help much in predicting the weather... The manual go back and forth on its usefulness.The altimeter readings are useless; they have to be recalibrated every time you change altitudes significantly.The thermometer is accurate -- but only if aren't wearing the watch for 30 minutes!The countdown timer goes up only to 60 minutes.The backlight doesn't have the "stay on" feature that Timex indiglo watches have. So, when you are trying to make settings to the watch in the dark, you are constantly interrupted by the fact the the light goes off after 2.5 seconds. Timex watches are smart enough to keep the light on if you are pressing other buttons.
4971850813,5.0,I've had mine since it was released in ~2006.  The battery meter still shows high and I've never replaced the battery thanks to the solar charging face.  I disagree with the other reviewer on the compass problem. Mine works very well but does need recalibration every several months if you need it to be perfect.  The altimeter is very close to perfect. Maybe off by 20-50ft but its a watch for crying out loud. I do enjoy the barometer for double checking my airplane when the field doesn't report pressure. I've loved it and its still ticking strong.
500000003X,5.0,It took me almost a month to break in these shoes (tight at first), but I persevered and now I love them!  They have saved me from many painful evenings after wearing other shoes to work!
500000003X,4.0,I have never ordered this brand of shoe before so I was a little worried about the fit. The shoe is very narrow and I do have narrow feet but they were still a little tight. After about a week and a half they fit perfect. The comfort level is more than I expected for the price.  I normally wear a size 6 so I order the 37 (6.5-7). So the only real problem I have is I can not wear this shoe with socks because it makes the shoe too tight on my foot. I really like the price and the feel; so I think I am going to order another pair/color and just order up a size. So if anyone is looking for a nursing shoe but don't wanna spend a small fortune this is the perfect shoe.
500000003X,5.0,These shoes are great, my feet do not ache at the end of the day.  They are snug around the top, but I have stretched them in the freezer and they are fine.
5000000048,1.0,Product appeared to be in excellent condition, but when I couldn't get one shoe on that was the problem, It was a completely different size. Don't think I will be using that site again. The cost of return was almost $10 for a product that was misrepresented!
5103277875,5.0,I was very happy with these...they arrived in time and are exactly what I expected.  They are going to make a great present to my kids graduating class!
5555012322,5.0,This t-shirt is 100% made from cotton and seems to be very high quality. I absolutely love the show and this t-shirt is a perfect way to feel yourself a part of it. Special thanks to Amber Promotions for a quick order handling, I live in NY and the shirt made it here in just 9 days all the way from Top Gear's homeland.
5555012322,4.0,Bought this for my husband for his birthday. Fits nicely, looks nice, and he gets complimented on it when he wears it. It's a &#34;sturdy&#34; shirt. Not super rough, but not very soft either. I think it's probably just fine for him, but I would have liked it a little softer t-shirt.
5555012322,5.0,If you need something to show your appreciation for the real Top Gear show and not the crappy local one get this shirt
5555012322,5.0,Got this for my dad as a father's day present.  He is a car guy and loves the show.  Wearing it at shows he gets tons of laughs, complements and is a great conversation starter.
5555012322,5.0,Firstly, thank you to everyone who mentioned sizing as it does in fact run small. Bought 2XL for our son who normally wears a large and it fit perfectly.Material seems superb, shipment arrived quickly and all seems exactly as advertised. He loves it.
5555012322,5.0,I love this shirt...I have wanted one for a long time.  Big fan of Top Gear.  The quality is excellent...the print is really well done and doesnt look like one of those cheaper shirts,  The back is a full size stig, and the colors (red and white) on black are nicely done.  Buy it...it is worth the money!
5555012322,5.0,Nice shirt.  Wish there was more Top Gear apparel available.  Seemed to run true to size.  Color has stayed nice after washing.
5555012322,5.0,Great shirt for anyone a fan of the show Top Gear. It is great shirt and great picture of the stig on the back.
5555012322,5.0,Everything went smooth with the delivery. The only problem was it's a Christmas gift and he found out on the day it was delivered.  Oh well.  :D
5555012322,3.0,Really large... too large. Bigger than an &#34;normal&#34; medium! The t-shirt looks good, but I'm not sure my boyfriend will wear it.
5555012322,5.0,great transaction and product
5555012322,5.0,This shirt looks just as advertised. Looks great on my husband. Washed up nicely, as well. Came many weeks before the estimated date. Everything about this purchase was great!
5555012322,5.0,This is a high quality shirt. I've washed it a couple times and the lettering hasn't faded at all. This is definitely worth the money I paid for it.
5555012322,4.0,My only gripe is that it was way too small and shipping costs high. Other than that it is very cool and I love the show.
5555012322,3.0,The quality of the material is nice and heavy duty.  It seems the UK XL runs smaller than the US XL since when I wear a US XL it fits loose and this shirt fits very tightly.  If I could actually wear it I probably would have given it 5 stars.
5555012322,5.0,A well made, comfortable, and well-sized t-shirt.Worth the buy, despite the shipping costs... and that's saying a lot, for me. I bought this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He's gotten quite a few compliments on it as well, and it's JUST a t-shirt!You also have to check out the tag... it's hilarious... but I won't ruin the surprise for you :)
5555012322,5.0,Loved the shirt!!! This was a birthday present for my husband, who loves Top Gear! The tag inside the shirt was even funny! Made his birthday!
5555012322,4.0,Sizes small.  My friend is a large, but the large I ordered was way too small.  I ended up getting him the XXL, which fits well.  His wife, who is a medium, stole the large.  It fits her perfect.
5555012322,5.0,great, had to replace one that got bleached and this didn't shrink too much would buy this again I don't know why I have to put a certain number of words in this
5555012322,5.0,I'm really struggling to figure out what to write.  I mean, the shirt is exactly what I expected and it stands up to my washing machine and dryer.  This product embodies the true essence of what a t-shirt should be.
5555012322,5.0,This shirt is exactly as it appears.  I got it for my husband because he is a huge fan of the show (and the stig).  Thanks for a great product.
5555012322,5.0,Big fan of Top Gear.  Ordered on the 16th and arrived on the 22nd - from the UK!  Just in time for Christmas! I never expected such fast shipment and delivery, especially at the holidays!  Great quality, sizing is spot on, perfect gift for Top Gear fans!
5555012322,5.0,I ordered this shirt for my husband and he really liked it.  He's a big, tall guy and the shirt looked really nice on him.  He said the collar was a little snug, but he likes Top Gear so much, I don't think it bothered him as much as a snug-collared shirt normally would.
5555012322,5.0,I bought it as a gift. He loved it. It was exactly what he wanted and it fits just right.
5555012322,5.0,I bought this for my husband. He loves this shirt and any fan of Top Gear would be very pleased.
5555012322,4.0,This was a gift, and I love it, but it's a little small.  I normally wear US Men's medium t-shirts (38-40) but like to go with a large when buying UnderArmour activewear or, expecting some shrinkage, 100% cotton.  This &#34;large&#34; was snug when I first tried it on (before washing) so now I have to make sure it's only washed in cold water and line-dried.  If you like a loose fit, you may have to order up a size or two.
5555012322,5.0,Great shirt. It arrived as promised , it was of very good quality and it fit perfectly. I would buy again.
5555012322,5.0,This was the #1 gift my son-in-law asked for for Christmas!  He loves funny T-shirts, and laughed so hard when he opened it.
5555012322,4.0,Ordered a Large, which is the size my son wears but it was a little tight. He still wears it, but probably not for long.
5555012322,5.0,Quick and good delivery. Perfect fitting and quality. Print was up to expectations. excellent present for car freaks or Top Gear fans.
5555012322,5.0,Can you believe that some people actually ask him who the STIG is? He really likes it! Buy one foe yourself!
5555012322,1.0,Sizing on all Top Gear apparel is at least two sizes too small.  This comes from the UK I guess were the sizing is apparently very different than America. Plus they shrink incredibly in the dryer.  XXL is too small for a 6 foot 190 pound man.  Beware!  I ordered two different shirts and ended up using them as rags.
5555012322,5.0,the t-shirt is everything I was expecting it to be. the fit is perfect. I also like the fact that it is genuine BBC Top Gear clothing.
5555012322,5.0,I have never ordered clothes on the internet before because the fit will always be a gamble. This shirt was a gift and it fit perfect. I was very impressed with the speedy delivery. I got it a week before the ETA.
555501239X,3.0,This was advertised as the BBC brand tshirt for a favorite show of mine.  I was disappointed by the quality of the printing.  The front looked great, but it was a simplistic line of text.  The image of the Stig on the back did not seem as high of quality as I would expect for a TV brand tshirt.
555501239X,3.0,There was no way for me to track this product. I received no shipping information on this product. Over all the product is fine some what over priced for a t-shirt.
555501239X,5.0,What can I say?  The tee shirt fit as expected. It is well-made and fun to wear. I would recommend this company.
555501239X,4.0,I ordered this on June 29 for a b-day party on July 14. After paying, shipping said it would arrive by July 29th, which would be too late. I was very pleased that it arrived by July 10, in time for the party. My husband LOVED the graphic and is quite pleased. We ordered size medium, it runs a little small but still fits him. 100% cotton, feels good to the touch. I gave it 4 out of 5 only because it's a smaller "medium" than other medium t-shirts. Great gift!
555501239X,1.0,I ordered an XL for my hubby, he is not huge but is tall.  This XL looks like a child's XL, it would be short on me.
5555014090,5.0,"My Dad is the Stig" t-shirt for our 4 year-old grandson was a hit since it fit him and his gave his Dad a big smile.  When questioned on the truth of the t-shirt, our son's reply was "No comment".
5555014368,5.0,This was just what I was hoping for, fits great, and made with quality material. Not to mention it arrived much faster than expected.
5555015038,5.0,Everytime I got into my car I used to think I was setting a lap time. This was becoming quite a problem as the local police really didn't appreciate a 1999 Honda coming around corners at a blistering 30 mph every day. I saw this shirt and had to have it. Now when I get into my car I look at my shirt and I am instantly reminded that I am not in a racing suit, and I can have a more relaxed drive to work without the authorities stopping me every 5 minutes
5555015038,5.0,I am a fan of TOP GEAR, there is no other reason to buy this well made shirt.  Well possibly one - the humor of the TOP GEAR label, sewn into the collar -- 'this shirt was tested on animals, it didn't fit'
5555015119,4.0,After reading all the reviews about the shirt running small, I was unsure about what size to get-- I am in the US and with shipping costs being so high, I wanted to get it right.  Well, my friend is a tall man, probably 6' 2&#34;, over 200 pounds (I don't know what that is in &#34;stone&#34;) and normally wears an XL in T-shirts.  The XXL was way, way too big!  I would have been better off getting a L.  My advice is to order true to size.  The material is a good weight, not too thin.
5555015119,5.0,I bought this shirt as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and it was perfect. The fabric is nice, good quality fabric and it arrived super fast! We both love Top Gear, so it was perfect :)
5699031936,5.0,i got exacty what i ordered. it is a very nice piece of jewelry.it is not something you would find very often.it is only sealed on the front side,leaving the stone to touch you.
6035555551,5.0,This was a gift for a friend I needed something special and unique,the craftsmanship is intricate and well done. the price only made ita greater buy.
6040383305,4.0,This is a very simple bracelet with what appears to be authentic baltic amber stones. Very rustic and natural looking. It is on a simple stretchy piece of string, so i don't really know how well it will hold up, or if it will end up stretching out. As far healing properties, i haven't noticed any positive effects yet, but haven't had any negative either.i wear it all the time (except in the shower). Beware that the image seen is NOT the actual bracelet you receive. Mine is very very dark with no variety in color like the image. But that was not what was important to me so it didn't matter much.
6040383305,5.0,this is a good quality product that has health benefits i appreciate. great for every day use. very comfortable on the wrist.
6040384441,5.0,This is amazing. Without it my lo is miserable. It calms her down. She no longer cries for hours at a time
6040384441,5.0,Normally my daughter goes thru about 3-4 shirts a day from drooling so much...but wearing this necklace she wore the same shirt all day long. I am amazed. Her pain from teething wasn't bothering her so she didn't have to chew her fingers therefore no excessive drooling!!
6040384441,4.0,Love them so far. I had to sign for the pkg because it was sent from Lithuania! I opened it and it was just the necklaces. Nothing else, no instructions or business card. Seemed a little sketchy to me. I googled how to see if you have real amber or not and it pasted both tests (it floats in salt water and it has a very sligh tangy taste).  My 2.5 year old hadn't been wearing one for about a week. She had had really watery eyes so I put one of these on her and the next morning her eyes were totally cleared up! So, I'm about 95% sure it's real &#128522; so besides the inconvenience of having to sign for a package and it seeming a little shady at first, I love this product!!!
6041006041,1.0,SO I WANTED THIS FOR A CONCERT THAT WAS 5TH OF JUNE AND I HAVENT GOT IT UNTIL NOW !!!!!!I ORDERED IT ON 22nd MAY, THATS LIKE 2 WEEKS EARLIER !!! R U KIDDING ME !!!!
6041616796,5.0,Nice heavyweight tee and great designs! Lettering was better than expected. Definitely would recommend this shirt and any others offered by this company.
6042496778,5.0,These are VERY comfortable, fit well, and look fantastic! I honestly have nothing else to say or even complain about, just a sincere thank you.
6148249588,2.0,The Hat was okay simply because it was sized properly for an adult, wasnt impressed with knitting as it looks like will unravel with slightest snag.
6152000629,1.0,The watch was nice but, when I  took it to a jeweler to remove links, there was a problem.It should have taken 3 min. to remove links and they worked on it for more than 30min. and still couldn't remove enough links to make it fit as I wanted. Jeweler said it was as though pins were too large and I should return to wherever I bought it!
6152000629,5.0,I love my watch its so cute and stylish MK watches look really expensive and even though its authentic you will find that it fades a little so don't wet it the seller finally shipped it I was worried a little at first because USPS took a while to ship but I am happy now
6152004780,1.0,The picture is deceptive.  The chain and stone are cheap looking. Fake sterling silver. Stone is not at all like the image. Very dull. Plain. Way too high a price for such a piece of jewelry. Don't bother w/ this piece.
6152004780,1.0,I like it but I think it's overrpiced. A bit smaller than I expected too. A total waste of my money.
6175001273,3.0,I was expecting more for my money. It will do for the purpose I need it for. The color is great
6175001273,4.0,Works well for my intended use. We are using the brooch as a Christmas ornament. It is a pretty piece for the price.
6175001664,1.0,This is poor fake product, he sold it as original and charge it at almost normal pricing, the pieces are falling off it after 5 office uses, the bracelet's pins are split in half. Bad product! Bad fake!
6181954635,1.0,The product looks beautiful in the picture but I was very disappointed after receiving it.  Not in good condition.  It was a shame because it was for a birthday gift.  Love shopping Amazon though.  Found so many great things for gifts.
7106116521,5.0,Exactly what I wanted.
7106116521,4.0,These little plastic backs work great.  No more loosing &#34;hook&#34; earrings!  Wish I had ordered these sooner before I had lost some of my favorite earrings!
7111324579,1.0,Supposed to look like Disney's dwarfs, huh? And what's with that Mickey head? How did they get that past Disney merchandising standards? Are they paying Disney their share for the Mickey head? I doubt it. Unlicensed Disney merchandise is a no-no.  And Dopey does not have a beard.
7211045639,5.0,Pretty and stylish...win, win.
7211045639,5.0,I love this bracelet, I get tons of compliments everytime I wear it and for as cheap as it was you can't get much  better.
7211045639,5.0,It was amazing when you try put it on show my friends and totally gonna love it and they like to have some too
7211045639,5.0,These bracelets are adorable. I personally like to wear a ton of bracelets on both wrists, and the miniature buckle is just darling. Ordered one in white, black, camel, dark brown, and red!
7211045639,5.0,Perfect casual accessory for that last extra touch on a chill outfit but can be dressed up. I was pleased with the product . It stays white also which is awesome.
7211045639,2.0,I was disappointed with this bracelet. The stitching on the tab part is sloppy. Looks cheap. I would not recommend this product.
7211045639,4.0,I like the product! It looks as it is shown and the size is adjustable so people with all sort of wrist sizes can wear it! It is something that is casual so it goes nicely with a a shirt and jeans in my opinion. The quality seems good and the color has stayed even though it has been a couple of months now.
7211045639,3.0,Cheap, and a bit too big for my tiny wrist. it looks okay though. I thought it would be a little less cheap, and actually more soft. Its really stiff, but not too bbad for the ladies with bigger wrists.
7211045639,4.0,This bracelet is really cool. I've had this for 6 months and I wear it nearly everyday. Although it's starting to finally wear and tear, I'd still recommend this. The only thing that sucks is that the delivery of this bracelet took a really long time. However, if you're willing to wait a few weeks, especially when the bracelet has a great cheap price, then totally go for this!!
7211045639,5.0,I got these to use as gift for the christmas and boy did we have fun with them, the girls loved them too
7211045639,1.0,THIS WAS JUST A STRIP OF LEATHER!  PICTURE WRAPPING A LEATHER LACE AROUND YOUR ARM. I WAS COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED AND ENDED UP THROWING IT AWAY.
7211045639,5.0,My 22 year old daughter had this in her wish list. When I got it, it is way prettier than the picture.
7211045639,4.0,It looks GREAT!... but coming from over seas took alittle longer then expected... Still I'm satisfied with the appearance of the bracelet..
7293005946,5.0,Wanted that blue blocker yellow with a less common rim frame (the large aviators with thin sides). The bridge fits well, the glasses are light (and more importantly, even), and they're packed with a nice bag.
7482782028,4.0,Nice little rosary. Did smell of Roses.  Wish the metal parts had been of better quality. Good rosary for some one just starting to learn.
7482782028,5.0,I bought this rosary as a Christmas gift for my sister.  She is a Catholic and her rosary had broken.  She was very happy to receive this special rosary that's actually made of rose petals and is blessed by the Pope.  She uses it every day to pray the rosary.
7482784861,5.0,This is a beautiful pendant. The finish is smooth and the images are very clear. You really get two pendants  because then the pendant is flipped over, there is a Christian symbol on it. Included in the package is a signed blessing by Pope Francis. I've received many compliments on this piece.
7482784861,5.0,I like St Michael and I find this item to be very nice, I purchased two and gave one as a gift to a relative.
7482785205,5.0,The coin purse on my wallet was just too small.After buying one of these in pink for my niece, I decided to give myself one.it seemed like it was kind of pricey when I put it in my cart but now that I have had it in the bottom of my purse for a while, it is worth every penny.Durable and eye catching are words I use to describe this coin purse.
7482785205,5.0,I needed a relatively small change purse because I don't like how heavy and bulky coins can make my actual wallet feel.  This was the perfect size and such a cute little fish.  I thought it was a little pricey for the genre, but love it just the same.
7482785221,5.0,My Daughter who's is named Theresa (age 12)for the Little Flower. Loves her Rosary and was so happy when it arrived earlier then expected. She says her prayers with it, as well as keeps it under her pillow.
7482785221,5.0,I purchased this rosary as a gift for my wife.  She really loves it and wants to purchase the same rosary for her mother now.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
7482785221,3.0,The rosary arrived and I was so relieved because the confirmation of the purchase said blessed by Pope Benedict, and I would never buy that.  Luckily, the card with the rosary said blessed by Pope Francis, which is what I was sure I had bought.  It was all good.  The rosary itself is a little less than I expected.
7501958645,3.0,I bought several of these hats for my daughter, she is 5-years-old to wear as she enjoys pretending she is a kitty. They are soft and durable. They stretch just enough to fit her head now. I have a tiny head so they fit me too, but her dad has a big head so they do not fit his head AT ALL. I fear she will grow out of them in a couple of months as she is already getting to be sooo tall. She only wears them when she is playing kitty.
7501958645,3.0,but is really cute! i cannot see how its actually a toy or anything, but, its nice. seriously, dont get it though if you have a big head!
7501958645,4.0,She has had this thing for a couple of months now she wears it a lot and it hasn't fallen apart yet.Amazon, don't make your reviewers give products irrelevant star ratings.  This isn't an educational toy.
7503681888,4.0,I think it's a really great deal: a huge collection for the price!!! My son loves them and I'd buy it again.
7503681888,5.0,My son was so happy to get them. he loves them so much. well made none have broke off so I am very happy!!!Got them so quick too.. Great place they have a ton of great ones!!
7549000212,3.0,It is o.k! It is not the same as pictured.The gloves were to short-had to add fabric.The pants were to small-had to make another pair.
7549000212,3.0,not bad...it's not what I expected but it's not too far off from it! the only problem I  have with this spongebob is that you can't really see out the eyes and the spongebob doesn't look like the spongebob in the picture I ordered! but again, it's not bad, great quality and a great price!three(3) stars because it didn't look like the picture that it betrayed to look like...four(4) stars for the quality of their spongebob....just use your own picture when you're selling a product!
7549000212,1.0,The sponge bob I got I'm not happy I want a new smaller sponge bob I'm not happy at all
7549000212,5.0,The costume was beyond are expectations! The satisfaction of the product it awesome!!!!!!! great work do to this costume ready for the next costume Barneyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
7801784235,5.0,This costume was fantastic. Extremely high quality, perfect sizing (relative to the actual angry birds) and it fit perfectly. It was shipped quickly, with great communication from the seller. I would ABSOLUTELY buy from this seller again. TOP NOTCH!
7842953562,4.0,I recently lost my medal of Nuestra Virgen del Cobre and have been in search of another that could do her justice and would stand out among my other few religious medals on my chain and I have to say yours caught my attention and I'd placed it among my top 5 to choose from. However, as far as I've ever heard, BLESSED ARTICLES or OBJECTS can NEVER be SOLD. Sorry. You may still choose to SELL it, regardless, but I'm NOT BUYING.
7842953562,4.0,I loved the medal but I developed a rash from the coating used.  It was very beautiful and well crafted
7842955867,2.0,Bracelet is not completed. (ends are not connected) If it would be connected it would not fit an adult it would be a small child.
7842955867,3.0,It arrived with many beads broken. The bracelet looks cute, but very delicate even in a good condition. Tiny beads. Did not open package to know if fragrance is as described. At this point, am not sure its the sellers mistake, maybe just a poor packaging. Boxing this item will definitely ensure safety for the bracelet. Putting this in a tiny ziplock bag was not very practical for such a fragile item. Will recommend better packaging in the future.
7884975238,5.0,This is such a gorgeous costume. The material feels so soft and smooth. It's a shame that I lost too much weight before purchasing it. A little big on me. &#62;.&#60; Though, I would recommend this costume to any beginning Tifa Lockhart cosplayer.
7884975238,5.0,This is probably the best cosplay outfit I have ever bought. Tifa's entire outfit is well made and the material is very good quality. It's almost like the real thing. This item arrived very fast and I'm very happy with the product. I definitely recommend this seller and this product. You won't be disappointed.
7884975238,5.0,This costume was amazing. It came in very good quality and looks exactly as pictured. I have worn it and have had very many compliments on how authentic to Tifa's it looks. I plan on wearing it to Sakura Con this up coming year.The only thing to remember when buying this is to pay close attention to the measurements and make sure that you have yourself measured properly. The above measurements are spot on and dont go buying the next size up because you think they are going to be too small. Other cosplay costumes do run small because the measurements are lost in translation, this one is accurate. I actually purchased the larger one just in case and it came very much too big. The seller was amazing however and helped to exchange it for me no issues.
7884975238,5.0,If you're looking for a cosplay Tifa outfit, this one is perfect! It looks great on, and it looks like the real deal. It's going to last a long time, and I got it very quickly! It was a big hit!
7890004311,3.0,It is not as good looking as the picture they use to sell it. It is a very close replica to the original for looks but for quality it could be easily sold for $50-60. Its a more lighter green then whats shown. Im happy with the product as a costume, I am unhappy with it as a collector, I have wasted money.
7966770882,5.0,This watch is better looking in person than the photo presents. Very satisfied with my choice.
7966770882,4.0,This is a watch fit for a gentleman like Thomas Anders.It is very thin, and almost looks like a bracelet on its own. The dial is impressuve with its goldtones.I had some trouble to shorten the bracelet, that is, remove some links because I have thin arms. I had to use a really small screwdriver to unscrew the links. Once you succeed in getting the right screwdrivers you're done. The bracelet itself is very glossy and goes well with the watch itself.One con: it seems that the watch is only water resist for daily use only.
7966770882,5.0,Solid construction.  The clasp is hidden but secure.  Super thin watch, with an elegant comination of silver, gold and black.  Wish it had the date.  I put the fake rolex in the drawer as this looks and attracts more attention.
7966780883,5.0,This watch is my favorite one - and I've had a lot of them along the way.  It's 10 years old and I have worn it 7 days per week over most of that time.  As one person said, it loses about 5 minutes per month but other than that it's been flawless.  It has a thin profile so it doesn't get in the way and I wear it a little loose like a bracelet.  I've hit it against things frequently but there's not a scratch on the face.  No batteries - imagine how nice that is.
7966780883,5.0,I ordered this watch on line just by looking at the picture.The watch met all of my expectations. It arrived in two days, was packaged perfectly and the watch was beautiful. It was a gift for my son and unfortunately, he did not like the square face of the watch- he wanted a round face. I returned the watch via the instructions on Amazon's web site. I was reimbursed the total cost of the watch and my return shipping.Thank you, Amazon, once again. You always exceed my expectations.
7966780883,5.0,Beautiful design, perfect execution. Timekeeping is very accurate, the sapphire lens is scratchless. Maintenance-free. So well balanced you don't feel it on your wrist.
7966780883,5.0,I have owned several watches throughout the past ten or so years.  Many of them were made by Fossil and Kenneth Cole, and I always had the same problem with these watches.  The face would always get scratches on it and the pin holding the band together would randomly fall out.  None of these watches lasted more than nine months to a year.  I have had this Citizen watch for a little over two years now, and I have never had any problems with it.  The watch still looks like new.  The sapphire face is virtually indestructable.  My only complaint with this watch is that mine runs a little slow.  For instance, after a month passes with out me adjusting my watch, it will be five minutes slow.  However, I could have this adjusted if I would take the time to take it to a store to get this fixed.  Overall, I would give this watch my highest reccomendation!
8087049098,5.0,I'm a life-long Star Trek fan. I've watched every series, movie and even the short lived cartoon series so when I saw this watch I had to have it.Those who have actually seen the original Star Trek series staring William Shatter as James T Kirk will immediately recognize that shade of yellow and that unique font. It's a great design for any fan of the original series.The watch has a leather band and stainless steel back. It keeps time perfectly and so far the battery is working great.My only complaint is that the Star Fleet emblem looks a bit fuzzy on my watch, I don't know if they all have this issue but you don't notice the problem unless you're looking very close so it's not a big deal.This watch isn't an official Star Trek product by any stretch of the imagination, but I knew it wasn't when I bought it and I'm glad I bought it. Sometimes an unofficial product can add flavor to a collection; it adds a sort of variety that official products alone can't provide.Considering the low, low price and the quality of the product I would recommend this watch to any Star Trek collector and the yellow color really brightens up my watch assortment.- Live long and prosper
8181475135,4.0,Took a little while to ship, but thats expected coming from over seas. Doesnt look exactly as styled but this id due to the package it was sent in. When worn and styled looks perfect!
8181475135,4.0,It's great quality and comes with everything you need, however, it's a little frizzier than advertised. So you might have to comb it down with something, but other than that it's a great buy!!
8181475135,5.0,My granddaughter loved the wig.  It was the envy of her friends, they all had to try it and asked where to buy.
8181475135,5.0,nice costume wigeasily trimmedcolor is very vibrantworked great for Comicon costumewill be able to use for Halloween as well
8181475135,3.0,I have a hard time deciding if the wig was actually like the product's picture. When I tried to style it as the picture shows,the wefts show very badly. However, the color is right and the length is right. The wig seems a little thin, because really if you try to style it any other way, you'll see through to your hair; or if you don't style it just right. Considering I'll be cutting the top part of it off and sewing a white wig in it's place for a Pascal cosplay, it should do nicely. I don't believe this would be something you would want to wear multiple days of the week. I can see for a convention when you want to spend time making sure the details are perfect. It seems like too much work for everyday.
8181475135,4.0,This wig was very well made - I just needed it for a halloween costume and had a hard time finding anything in true-red, but this one worked.  The shape of it is strange, the bangs cover your face, but it's nothing a little trim couldn't fix (or some clips, but I went with scissors).  It's better construction than most costume shop wigs.
8181475135,4.0,It arrived earlier than said and is fantastic! I'm using it for my Matt Death Note cosplay! But there is a slight problem, some little strands fall off but it's really no big deal!
8181475135,4.0,Bought this wig for a Trickster Dirk Cosplay.The wig came in and it wasn't too shabby looking in the realness factor considering what an unnatural shade it is. The wig was really easy to style as long as you're ok with using quite a few pins and quite the amount of hairspray. Definitely buy from this seller again.
8181475135,5.0,As soon as I put it on I loved it! The wig sheds a bit but im sure all wigs do. The wig is very nice and the hair is thick. It adjusts to fit your head perfectly. It is not what i had expected when i ordered it. I imagined i was getting what i paid for... A rats nest of thin unmanageable hair. Boy was i wrong! This wig was the perfect! I will be getting another. Thanks!
8279996834,3.0,I ordered this for my nephew in the Air Force. The description notes it arrives in a velcro closure carrying case for. The medal is nice but it came in a little purple nylon bag you would store rings or earrings in. Not appropriate for something a man would carry in his pocket.I was very disappointed.
8511000135,1.0,Received it quick but had to find a way to put it on baby. It lasted a couple of weeks and then it broke. I don't even know where it ended up.
8742238846,4.0,This item claims to be blessed.  A blessed sacramental should not be sold according to the Catholic faith. Please take this out of stock or change the title if it is not a blessed sacramental.
8742239338,5.0,Excellent, productGood presentationI recommend these folks to all.My family and I are very happy with this purchase.
8742239745,5.0,This was a great purchase for my Mom!! It was a great birthday gift for her she still uses it. I am very happy with the purchase.
874224241X,5.0,What better than jute for a coin purse?!I saw this and knew it had to be part of the gift package for my niece.It is not large but it is not super small either. I liked it so much that I ended up ordering the natural jute coin purse for myself.
8742245001,5.0,This coin purse is too cute! It's just the right size for my change. It could hold a chapstick, but not any sort of cards, like a credit card or license.
8742245095,1.0,The card slots are nothing more than cuts in a thin piece of leather with a piece of fabric glued in. When trying to put a card in, the edge of one of the slits tore completely in two and another is well on its way. The adhesive didn't hold so the fabric came out with the card so now there's a sticky residue and the cards slide down so far they're all bunched behind the bottom slot. I ordered two and the same thing happened when my Mom tried using hers. We weren't at all rough with them, they're just that poorly made. I will definitely never purchase from this seller again if this is the type quality that can be expected.
8742245095,3.0,I wanted something that could take he place of my wallet and my smartphone case. This fit the bill. I saw other but didn't want to spend a ton of money. I ordered and received. It is not an accordion style wallet as it states but that's ok with for now. I was hoping it held more stirage, but again I'm happy not to be carrying a bulky wallet and smartphone case. So other then it not being an accordion style it's ok, I happy with it.
8742245117,4.0,It's exactly as the picture so very cute and fun. My only problem is the space...once I put everything in there I have trouble snapping the wallet closed but then I also I my checkbook in it. But it does fit everything I need in my wallet.
8742245117,3.0,This wallet is cute, and just as pictured.  There isn't a whole lot of room and after placing my checkbook, cards, receipts, etc it was hard to snap closed.  It is beginning to stretch a little more now though.  The canvas gets dirty very easily, but I was able to wipe clean fairly easily.  Also, I've just started to notice that a few of the stud are beginning to fall off.  I do like the wallet though even though I believe it's overpriced.
8805003204,5.0,Bought this as a gift for my husband and am glad I did. Looks a lot more expensive than it is and is a great way to display watches and cuff links and keep them safe.
8862938861,5.0,If you are a Moleskin fan, this luggage tag is a must-have. It is authentically Moleskin, down to every detail, beautifully designed, perfectly crafted.
8862938861,3.0,I don't know how they do it, but Moleskine manages to reach directly into my pocket and take money out of my wallet.  This is the first time I don't believe the money's been worth it.Simply put, it's a lot of money for something so simple as a luggage tag.  Is it neat?  Yes.  Does it have cool, classic Moleskine styling?  Yes.  But is it worth it?  Probably not.The three things a luggage tag needs to do is: identify the owner of the bag, provide the bag with a distinctive mark for the owner to quickly retrieve it, and provide a distinctive mark so that non-owners don't accidentally take it.It does the first well enough, except that unlike other tags it doesn't have any way (via a removable business card or the like) to change the information.  Once you write in there, it's good.The second two, it doesn't do as well, at least in black.  Yes, it's distinctive, but not _that_ distinctive.  In my case, it's just another black tag on a black bag.  The other color tags would definitely add more pop and distinctiveness, but also lose the homely Moleskine charm.All in all, it seems sturdy enough to take abuse and will hold your information in it, but does it justify the price differential versus something you could pick up at a drug store?  No, probably not.
8866138096,5.0,Do yourself a favor, listen to me and buy a bunch.  They are so handy for mini MP3 players and earbuds!!
8866138371,1.0,Because as you should know i ve neer got it!.You lost it in Transit.It was a realyy proble x me.Diego Echandi
886613984X,5.0,This was a fabulous bag, but  I ordered it for a special trip and it turned out not to be what I needed. I was able to return it with no problem whatsoever.  I would definitely do business with Adorama again.
886613984X,5.0,I was looking for a black bag which featured a zipper for safety in train rides and in general. I also wanted a bag which I can use everyday and put inside my computer if needed. This bag is really practical, feels great, it is light and looks great. It even includes a little Moleskine notebook. Highly recommend it.
8921463216,5.0,Everbody loves my sandals, a little narrow around the toes, maybe a size up wouldve been a better choice. Love themThank You
8921463240,1.0,The sizes were off! I ordered a size 6 they  sent  a size 3 ! needlessly to say.the young girl was most unhappy so was I!But I felt that it was not worth returning it all the way back to Korea!.
8921463267,2.0,These shoes are extremely pretty. Not pink like pictured, more salmon colored, but looking great. They are not light, they are made of good rubber material. BUT here is the problem, the edges of the straps are so sharp that it's impossible to wear. They will give you nasty cuts. I only wore them around the house today and I have cuts on my toes. Such a shame because they are so pretty and they're made out of such great quality rubber. Wish they would make the edges in a different way.
895274649X,5.0,I bought this bag for my daughter for school. She loves it!  It has really been durable. The water bottle that comes with it is a little less durable the lid snapped off but other than that she still uses it.  She loves the book back and we have not had any trouble with it so far. It is extremely cute too.
8970463682,5.0,Bought as a gift..He is going to love this unique backpack...The item was shipped promptly and I received in a few days...I am overall happy with my purchase of this Spongebob Squarepants backpack..
8970463682,5.0,I am so glad I bought this back pack, he is the only one at school with a backpack not bought at walmart (lol)
8970463682,5.0,Our niece loves Spongebob, so of course she was going to love this.  It seemed to suit her just fine.
8970463763,5.0,I bought this backpack for my 5-year-old who wanted a roller backpack and likes Hello Kitty. She loves her backpack, even if it's very big for her. It's a little pricey for a kid's backpack, but I suppose that's what I have to pay for branding. I do not use the cheap water bottle that came with the backpack. I do not know the type of plastic it's made from.
8970469826,5.0,I have bought this for my neice as her gift for her birthday.She used to have another Spongebob bag with wheels (like hand luggage you take into a plane) but one of the wheels broke down so i bought her this back-bag to avoid the wheels since she loves spongebob.The material is good, feels durable and can easily last with her two school years (or maybe till she grows over Spongebob crush lol).The lunch bag is a nice touch and can carry a sandwich with a juice box and still have a tiny space for a small bar of chocolate or biscuits.The Spongebob toy is not the best, feels that it needs more stuffing inside it, but it does the job for a 5 years old girl to have it sleep next to her on bed every night.
8970469826,5.0,Everything seems sturdy and well made and although its not the cheapest Spongebob backpack we came across, its bigger and my son will be able to use it for years to come.
899634480X,5.0,I bought my first pair of FILA Skele-toes shoes last year and I grabbed a couple of pairs of these socks when I did. Boy was I glad. They make the shoes easier to get into, make it so you shoes don't smell, and are super comfy. This brand is the only one so far that I have found that is thin enough, stay up and wears well. I live in a pretty rural area so I either have to buy online or wait till I can get to a larger city to find them, but they are so worth it.
899634480X,4.0,The socks themselves work great, although I would have rather bought black. This is a horrible price for these socks. I just bought two pair at a local sporting good retailer for fourteen dollars. And to think that I thought the local retailer was too high priced! Wow!In fact, I started searching Amazon because I thought for sure I could find a lower price on these type of socks here. I was wrong. If internet shopping kills the brick and mortar stores we are all in for a rude awakening!
899634480X,5.0,I love these socks. I have like 8 pairs of them. They are super comfortable. It came in very fast
899634480X,4.0,These toe socks do their job.... just don't happen to be black and are more work of keep white like I want them.
899634480X,5.0,the gift receiver loves these and so dose my daughter. the older is less and . it helps keep his feet warm so everyone is happy
899634480X,4.0,Toe shoes feel much better with socks!  I highly recommend these sock for those who enjoy wearing the toe shoes.
899634480X,5.0,I love using toe socks with fivefingered shoes. I'd rather wash my shoes because of visible dirt than because of funky smells. These socks have a nice silky feel to them, and it's very easy to "scoot" your toes up into your shoes. I have noticed, though, that the Fila socks weave doesn't have as much all around stretch as the Injinji socks. My little toes are stubborn, and the Injinji socks make it easier to get those last little piggies into the sock. The Fila socks can end up snug on one side of your toe, especially right after a shower. Just an observation I've made after a few months of comparing the two brands. The thickness of the Fila socks is perfect. Not so thick as to impede your comfort, and not so thin that your foot slides around in the shoe. The "no-show" sock does show on the top of your foot, but the heel stays in place perfectly. I've never had the back of the sock slip down.
899634480X,5.0,I have a crooked toe problem and have tried five finger shoes before, but never with socks. Thus getting into them was a pain in the you know what. When I got my Filas I resolved to try them with socks. What a difference, both in ease of entry and the actual feel of the shoe. My Filas slide right on, and don't feel clammy or chafe during work outs.The socks are a lot easier to put on, because of more access to the toes.So far my pair have worn and laundered well, although I would prefer that a 1/4 or 1/2 crew were available from Fila.I also received a pair of true five finger shoes as a gift, and decided to try them with socks as well. The difference was so great that I decided to keep those shoes as well.
899634480X,4.0,Loved the fit of the socks with the skele-toe shoes. Very comfortable! Only wish the socks came in more colors because I not only wear the shoes for running but as a fashion statement.
899634480X,1.0,Not very comfortable at all, at least better than bare foot in the skele-toes shoes.However, these overpriced socks only lasted 2 days. A hole on the side was torn on the third time I tried to put them on where it is a pain to do so to begin with anyway.
899634480X,5.0,I wear the toe socks now to keep my toes from digging into each other.  Fantastic to finally have relief.
899634480X,5.0,Great toe socks for the money. Fits my feet like a glove and are very breathable. Would recommend over the competitor's toe socks. Great to wear with Skele-Toe and Five Finger shoes along with just bare footing around the house.
899634480X,1.0,I ordered these for my son's birthday. They say they are adult's size 6-12 but they wouldn't fit a child.
899634480X,3.0,They certainly don't go kids' feet. My sone wears a size 2 shoe and they are way too big for him.
901248068X,5.0,Excelente producto recomendado.. lo recomiendo! funciona excelente y llego a tiempo, excelente envoltura y tal cual lo describio el vendedor
9033700018,5.0,I bought this in 2 other series/designs for myself and to give away as gift bags.  I had a gift that was unusual in shape and I couldn't find a gift bag to place it in.  I had a set of these pouches and placed the gift in one of them, included a copy of instructions on how to fold the bag (included with the set) and gave it to her to reuse when she wants to go shopping!  So I decided to get other designs, keep the bags I want and use the others for gift bags again.  It's very portable, attractive, sturdy.  Great for traveling when you need an extra bag.  Oh, and it's good for the environment to keep reusing it.  I was compelled to get this particular design for the retro look because it's so quirky!
9033700026,5.0,so easy to carry along with you, very sturdy & hold a lot of stuff,& cute graphic designs are a bonus--I want to buy a set for all myfriends
9033700026,5.0,Really - Envirosax makes  it easy to do the right thing and bring your own bags to the store. They are so handy and fold into practically nothing, yet they hold a ton and are attractive to boot!
9033700026,5.0,You can pack a ton of items in these bags and they are still pain free on the hands and shoulders. I'll order some more for family members.
9038900074,5.0,I love this blue bag.  It's big, holds a lot, is very sturdy, washes well in the laundry, and is easy to stuff into the inside pocket.  It packs small and I always have it with me.  I've used it for about four years and it's not wearing out at all.  I stuff it full of heavy items and it has not torn or been damaged at all.  I like that I don't have to fold it, I just stuff it into the inner pocket, fold the flap over the top, and it's all packed up.  The strap has a piece sewn in that makes the top of the strap a bit sturdier.  It is larger than the plastic bags from the grocery store.  I got something dark and greasy on mine this week.  I don't know what it was but it came out in the wash.  This is the only reusable bag I've ever used.
9502736508,5.0,This rosary is absolutely gorgeous and I use it a lot.  The archangel Raphael is very special to me so this rosary is too.
9502736508,4.0,The rosary is quite lovely.  it's much prettier than the photos, and the facets really reflect the light.  I am very happy with this purchase .
9502736508,5.0,This rosary is unique and beautifully made.  I love the angel center, and the cross is weighty and strong.  Thank you.
9502736508,5.0,I bought this for my Granddaughter for her Confirmation.  She had taken the name &#34;Michael&#34; for her Confirmation name and she was quite pleased with the Rosary.
9502736508,5.0,This was purchased as a gift for a fellow Catholic school teacher who is retiring early due to her fight with cancer.  This item is even more beautiful than the picture shows.  It is well made, comes with a prayer card, and in a nice box.
9502736508,5.0,Absolutely beautiful. Arrived in perfect condition and also arrived early. I highly recommend. I think the price could definitly be a little lower. but excellent quality.
9502736966,4.0,These are beautiful. Sparkly. The only thing is that neither one of the two bracelets came with the card stating papal blessing. I am hoping it was still blessed. That is the only reason that kept me from giving these bracelets a 5 star review
9502736966,5.0,This is a great bracelet with lots of shine.  Have received many compliments.  Good price for the product.  Would recommend.
9502736966,5.0,It looks pretty! I bought it for my daughters first communion and the clear beads are sparkly with the catholic symbols on it makes it perfect for her.
9502738349,1.0,When a blessed item is sold, the blessing is lost.  Therefore, if someone were to sell an item that was blessed by the pope, for example, the blessing would be lost.  The person who purchases the item would not have an item blessed by the pope as the blessing would be lost.  Blessings can never be sold.  Even if the seller explicitely states that the blessing is not being sold, it is still lost.  The blessing cannot be passed on if the item is sold, traded, or bartered.  To imply that the blessing continues after the sale is simony and fraud.  You cannot ever buy, trade for, or barter for a blessed item and still retain the blessing.
9533222980,5.0,This was a great necklace I'm actually wearing right now and I love rainbow colors and it goes well with my clothing.
9533224029,5.0,The earrings from gifts by lulee are beautiful, came in a really nice box. My daughter loves the earrings and they are good quality. I ordered a pair for myself. Highly recommend this site to others and will order again from Lulee.
9533224029,4.0,Received product on time.  Was as expected, quality was great.  Gave as a gift to a friend and she loved it.
9533224266,5.0,I've order 2 -off them,cuz 1 is mine & the other is a Special Gift for my Niece.She is gonna Luv it.They are very Nice & They are Blessed By the Pope..I Luv it! Again thankyou soo much to Amazon!
9571353221,4.0,Service: okDelivery time: okProduct: okBut you may have problems if you are &#34;western&#34; and maybe your hands are too big to fit in (even if you choose the XL), so be sure to measure your hands and compare with the size chart
9571353221,5.0,you have to love the anime and where this glove properly for your usage and love it the way you can, i LOVE IT it keeps me warm and i feel like an anime character >,&lt;
957349230X,4.0,super short, I used it for my Halloween costume as a leopard of course. but other than that I cant use as a regular dress. the material is thin but not too thin that you can see any under garments. id buy again
957349230X,5.0,This dress is so sexy. Some of my girl friends gave me alot of compliments when they saw it. Ti fits so good
957349230X,1.0,I just recieve my leopard mini clubbing dress today..and im not very happy with it ! The style and the fabric that I order is not even look the same like in the picture...im so very frustrated :(
957349230X,5.0,I was a little reluctant to buy this dress after reading some of the reviews, however, when it came in the mail I was completely astonished that anyone could possibly complain about this gorgeous, unbelievably sexxy, and perfectly fitting dress.  I wore it the first time on a date with my boyfriend and I could tell that he was having a really hard time (excuse the pun) keeping his composure.  This dress is, by far, my favorite dress in my entire wardrobe.  The material is not cheap and thin at all.  As a matter of fact, I would describe it as thick and fuzzy...it is high quality...making the price unbelievable.  I can see how some people might complain about the fit, though, because it fits so perfectly that you really need to have the body for it.  Girls that are &#34;thick&#34; (or whatever overweight people call themselves now a days) will probably hang out of it.  It is the perfect length for me (I am 5'8&#34;, 120lbs) and fits tightly but not too tight.  I just can't say enough good things about this dress. If you are not heavy and you want to steal the show wherever you go...then this is the dress for you!
957349230X,1.0,it was not how i expected it to be i am dissapointed i expected it to be lower from the back but it was like a shirt
957349230X,3.0,it's just ok. Overall it is too big, doesnt have low back scoop or neckline that was shown/described.  The material is cheap. but you get what you paid for, wish I would have saved my time and money though, too much work to return.
9620764617,5.0,Really nice (:
9620764617,5.0,As soon as you pick up this hat you can tell it is a quality product. It just feels solid. Very quick delivery and excellent service.
9620764617,1.0,I was thinking i was buying a legit hat..instead i was sent a fake one, i was not happy with my product i recieved.
9620764617,1.0,MY SWAG METER IS OFF THE CHARTS NOW. I NOW HAVE SO MUCH SWAG THAT ALL MY FRIENDS WANNA BE LIKE ME YO
9620764617,5.0,Soo much sweg!  I have all de bitchs now, evry dey sumbody sez how much Sweg I have I would recommend this snap back to anybody who wants to have swag too
9621434939,5.0,This wig looks exactly like it does in the picture. It fits very well and has straps enclosed on either side which join at the back, making it stay on with no trouble at all. My hair is down to my waist and is quite thick, so I was happy it came with a wig cap (which was also high quality!). The costume I needed it for required a flipped-out-ends look, and I was able to flip out the ends with a low setting on my straightening iron with no trouble. It was so realistic, a couple of people actually though I cut my hair! It did take about two and a half weeks to arrive here in the states, which was significantly faster than the expected arrival date. I would highly recommend this, especially for the price.
9626781793,3.0,My expectations have been met and I'm happy overall, but it arrived 6 days late. This is a worth while buy though.
9626819502,5.0,As someone who rarely wears undergarments this is great. Barely feels like you have anything on, but like I said the vagina sweat puddle was a bit uncomfortable. Other than that no complaints. It also came in handy when my eldest was mouthing off in the back of  the mini-van on the way to dropping kids off to school and I couldn't smack him. I certainly didn't want to throw my perfectly good coffee mug with fresh coffee at him. So I took these babies off and flung it right at him smacking him in the mouth. Easy punishment access!
9626819502,5.0,because I'll want to take it away with them.It's hot!ah.. er... and it's also very good if you want to use it for bodypainting!
9626819502,2.0,Great idea,but they haven't perfected itThe tail piece loses it's spring back shape,which keeps the thing stayed putThe front edge is also curved outward when it should be curved inward to lay flat against the bodySOLUTION  :  I put it in a steamer basket with the water boiling below it and after a few min.Your able to re-bend the tail piece tightly into the C shape as well as put a slight inward bend to the front top edgeJust wish the C Thong would hold its shapeWhen they find something with more spring back for the frame it will fit much better and not start falling off after an hr or so
9626819502,5.0,It was fun to &#34;play&#34; with, as well as the fact that there's no panty line in slim fitting dresses. I love it.
9626819502,5.0,- It fits perfectly... very snug: A little confused on how to wash without damaging: maybe a lingerie bag??- is exact to picture: fits on snug.
9626819502,1.0,When I finally received the item it either bent from shipping or bent from just being poor quality. It is very uncomfortable. The fabric is like almost like swimsuit material, very weird. It doesn't stay in place. Can't see wearing this for more than 2 minutes. Don't waste your money... this product is pointless.
9626819502,1.0,I tried it, thought it would be neat, but think it through, every time you have to do anything in the bathroom, you have to take it completely off and hold it in your hand or put in on the counter.  That and I also think the wire is to bulky, I feel like everyone else can see the outline under my clothes.
9626819502,5.0,Whoever came up with this idea, I am pleased.  what a unique way to wear a thong. Would order again, though I was not sure when I first ordered it.
9626819502,2.0,My wife liked the concept but not the color, she feels it looks like she is wearing a feminie napkin, we bought black and it looks better.
9626819502,4.0,Bought this for a Photo-shoot instead of a G-sting. The models were surprised to see something like this........ but it work and photograph well
9626819502,4.0,good productI chose this product for the designI like their shape, color and qualityI recommend this product is good quality, and arrived on the agreed date
9626819502,5.0,sexy little number. wears well with dresses and makes me feel naked. great design and comfy so try it today
9626819502,1.0,I am not satisfied with the C string that I received.  I think it would be ok if the plastic was not twisted.  They shipped it in an envelope too small and therefore distorted the plastic.  I cannot wear it because of the twisted plastic, it's distorted and sticks out farther on one side.Maybe I didn't order from a reputable seller, I don't know.  I think I will go into the *** store here and purchase one.THREW IT AWAY.
9626819502,5.0,The first time I heard about this particular type of underwear, I laughed and said it was better to not wear any underwear at all! Then, as a bride wearing a ball gown wedding dress with a hoop skirt, thigh highs, and a garter belt, I was posed with a serious question: If I wore regular underwear, how would I go to the bathroom? I didn't want to be undoing and redoing my garter belt all night just because i had to pull down my underwear, so I remember these. I figured I'd give it a try as they looked uncomfortable and didn't seem like they'd fit me (I'm a &#34;more-to-love&#34; kind of girl). I was very pleasantly surprised when I tried them on for the first time though; they fit me, stayed put, and were incredibly comfortable! The best part is, I will be able to take them off to use the restroom and not have to fuss with straps, and fluff, and everything else under a wedding dress. Just pop it off, do your business, and pop it right back on! Brilliant! I will definitely have to buy more for other occasions.
9626819502,3.0,Awkward to wear but a fun surprise for the lucky viewer. It also worked as a great gift for the girls I hang with.
9626819502,2.0,Not what i excpeted. Very cute n all but very  uncomfortable , irritating.if it was made out of different material.and i do have a big buttox and it wasnt fitting right.
9626819502,2.0,My wife is a small frame but she has a bit of a pooch and it wouldn't pinch very well and wants to pop off if you're not wearing something over it.  It also rubs in the back at the top of the crack so she never wears it.
9626819502,4.0,Finally! A maxi pad and fart muffler all in one! Unfortunately it's only good for a one time use, unless you are going to a Corey Feldman party in which case you can actually make a decent profit off of the skid mars string
9626819502,1.0,The bone is too big. It protrudes under clothing which defeats the purpose of using it in place of traditional thongs. If I knew it was like this, I would not have bought them.
9626819502,4.0,Bought this for the tanning booth, and I assume it will do it's job.Only gripe I have is the color I received. I ordered a light beige but received a pink one.
9626819502,5.0,This is a great product!  This is especially helpful on those big drinking weekends!  When I go out on Friday nights I put it in as a headband.  That way, when I realize I lost my pants I can just whip it around!
9626819502,1.0,I bought this because it seemed like a good idea at the time unfortunately the end got stuck up my butt and im now waddling maybe I should go to the e.r?
9626819502,5.0,Perfect 60th birthday for my youngest sister!!  She and her son and d-i-l got quite a laugh out of them.
9626819502,4.0,fine for ladies who want to impress...nice and extravagant ..........red is good color and white must be good ...also fits well
9626819502,1.0,I usually love when my husband buys me lingerie but this was so tiny I have no idea what he was thinking but it is still sitting in the packaging it came in.
9626819502,3.0,My wife did not like it that much, but I loved it. I accidentally got the wrong size for her but now I can not send it back because of warranty issues and when she actually got it, living in another country.
9626819502,2.0,This product did not work well for me...maybe because I am very slender.  I gave it to my Full-Figured sister. Would not recommend this product.
9626819502,4.0,If you want a silky-soft panty to wear all day under a skimpy dress, you're better off with a thong or V-string. But for a naughty little something on a special night, this is perfect! It curves comfortably and snugly; the mesh cloth is not too sturdy, but it's smooth and breathable; and yes, it is very sexy. My husband loves it even more than I do. ;)
9626819502,2.0,Let me start by saying that I am a man and, as such, the contents of my undergarments are different than those for whom this product was designed. Sadly, I did not discover this until after purchasing and trying the C-String.My wife and I were celebrating our 5th anniversary and I wanted to do something special to surprise her after dinner. I figured that we would have plenty of time that evening as my custom is to spend $1 per year that we've been together on each of our meals and that price point doesn't lend itself to multiple courses.I quickly discovered the C-String while doing alphabetical research on "exciting underwear" and I immediately ordered one. Between its exciting novelty and presumed ease of removal (more on this later), I was sure that my wife would feel like the luckiest girl in the world and that this would translate to an exciting evening.3-5 business days later, on our anniversary, I received a discrete brown box with a smile on the outside and giddily ran it upstairs to the bathroom where I could lock the door and be alone. Immediately, I wished that I had brought my computer with me as the product came without instructions and "installation" was not turning out to be intuitive. Without an online resource to guide me, I was forced to experiment.As it happens, and completely by accident, my first attempt ended up being correct (in terms of orientation), but I didn't realize it because of the awkward result that the C-String had in parting the company of certain anatomical neighbors for which distance is a source of pain. Plus, the C-String kept slipping down in a way that, from the back, probably resembled a video tape being ejected from a VCR.I tried reversing the garment. This solved the problem of parted anatomy in the front, but created a similar (and similarly painful) issue in the back. I found that squatting and bending forward alleviated some of the pain, but decided that maintaining this position for the entirety of our anniversary celebration, might clue my wife into the the surprise that lay in store for her, thus threatening the full force of its impact and the excitement that would be derived therefrom.Next, I tried wearing donning the C-String in a horizontal, rather than vertical configuration - with the band going around my hip. Initially, I found no discomfort, but as I stood there admiring my ingenuity in the mirror, I realized that something wasn't right. Imagine a pirate with his eyepatch covering his ear instead of his eye and you'll have a pretty good idea of what was going wrong for me.Again, my thoughts wandered to my computer but I could hear movement outside the door and knew that unless I wanted to risk discovery, I was on my own. I studied the C-String intently for a while and decided that the skinny end must go in back. The pain, I decided, I could handle, but how could I prevent it from slipping down? Then it hit me: Maybe the skinny bit at the back wasn't supposed to remain external (if you know what I mean).What happened next is something that I won't share, but it involved deep questions about my level of love and commitment to my wife, a small container of Vaseline, some blood, and some tears. I decided to hide the C-String and come back to it after I had found a computer and an ice pack.Sadly, I did not have time to consult my computer or experiment any further before the time came to depart for the restaurant. Not wanting to waste the C-String, I adjusted the frame ever-so-slightly and told my wife that it was a Google Glass that I was going to use to record our date. Happily, she believed me and was thrilled at the idea. Sadly, she shared my plans with the woman who took our order at the restaurant and we were immediately asked to leave.On the plus side, I didn't have to explain why I didn't have any video of our evening. 2 Stars.
9626819502,5.0,This panty is fantastic, simple, comfortable to use with your favorite clothes and intimate moments is practical and sexy I see your partner
9626819502,1.0,It comes and a little package and my wife opened but it comes like sideways, she tryn to weared and breakes
9626819510,3.0,This thing is a joke :))  Ordered it to just have fun...  Wore it once...  There is no support and if don't move around much it is &#34;doable&#34;, otherwise it is constanly falling out or off (i am not sure what is the right description for this thing :))  So if you wear tight pants and need no lines then this panty is perfect...
9629558424,5.0,I love these & I wear them depending on which bra I wear. I'm just glad they've made bra extenders!
9629558424,5.0,I have used extenders off and on over the years, when the bra cup fit is perfect but it's just a LITTLE too tight around the ribs, and I have to say, these ones I purchased recently are THE BEST! They are VERY well made, very smooth and you don't notice them AT ALL (previous ones I've used had little nylon threads that stuck out of the edges and were scratchy and really annoying all day (and yes, I did try melting the threads down with a match to soften them, but it still didn't help). So, ladies, if you need good, comfortable, well-made bra extenders, these are the ones to buy!! You can't go wrong for $6 bucks! Order quick, though, they take a little while to get here, they ship from Hong Kong....GOOD BUY!!
9629558424,4.0,good price, works well for that extra little extension, nice that it comes in three different colors, will order some with four hook.
9629558424,5.0,I purchased these extenders because i am pregnant and did not want to go out and buy all new expensive bras that I wouldnt be able to wear post-pregnancy, This is the perfect product. They fit onto all my bra hooks perfectly and do not fall off or come undone. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to up their bra size temporarily!
9629558424,4.0,I didn't even know these existed.  They're great, especially after the holidays!  Very convenient to use.  I will see how they wash.
9629558424,4.0,This is perfect fit for the hooks as expected, and provides a room for about an inch more. It saved me spending money on new ones when I gained a little weight. I liked this product.
9629558424,5.0,These things are awesome and work really well. There will be a total of six small plastic packages that have two in each. They give four of each color and the hooks do run a bit smaller than your regular bra but it does not change the quality of the product. I'm sure there are one or two bad bra extenders in the bunch but the price is MUCH better than anything else on amazon. This is a must buy!
9629558424,5.0,Reading the header, I thought I would be getting some 2x3 extentions as well, but they were all 3x3.  Other than that, they are well made and sturdy, in other words, perfect.  Although the shipping did take quite some time (not a Prime order) I got some EXCELLENT Chinese stamps out of the deal.  Packaging was sufficient to made it across the ocean unscathed. I am overall very pleased with this purchase, plus just tickled about the stamps. ;)
9629558424,5.0,I got these because I gained a few pounds and my bra made my &#34;back fat&#34; fold in half. it was very unflattering. But these hook extension fix that problem and make my bras wearable again. they are very durable (I've had mine for almost 6 months and they show no signs of wear) and the colors are perfect. They come in all the right sizes and are very inexpensive. Will buy these again.
9629558424,1.0,I am very unhappy with the dealer . As i order this product in the month of december and still after 6 months i didnt get this product. I have contacted 2 times with the dealer and they ensured me to send it again in the month of feb . But still i m not getting this product . I strongly recommended not to buy this product from this dealer as its a waste of money .
9629558424,4.0,the extenders worked great we received them in great time  only one strap had a flaw but it was minor
9629558424,4.0,I order this and it took some time to arrive but when it arrived it was in good condition. I gave it 4 stars because the sender didn't tape the package well so almost anyone can easily open the package and take items out of it. It's coming from China so it took about 2 weeks to arrive. Product itself is good, no problems in that area.
9629558424,4.0,I saw this product in Walmart and thought good idea.  I checked AMAZON and found this product but in more sizes and coloursplus got a bunch of them for a fraction of the cost at Walmart, who only have one colour and one size and one per package.I use these extensions on good bras I thought I would have to throw out.
9629558424,5.0,They are many of them, cheaper than buying them At Walmart and are very well made! Will order again in the futurre
9629558424,2.0,I chose these because the price was so good.  I should have paid a little more attention...they are shorter than extenders I've previously purchased (requiring use of two of them on one bra) and I didn't notice the hooks and eyes are not colored to match.  Left me wishing I'd paid a little more to get better quality.  Considering all this, they're appropriately priced.
974404117X,5.0,dammmn s0n I recoomend this watch for them ballers for the raiders dor the hawks. What I'm saying is that if you aint talkin money you wouldnt understand
978979262X,2.0,Looks much cheaper in person than on line. The fabric is what does it. Stitching is good but just cheap design.
978980539X,5.0,We have purchased other Tommy B. destination shirts and are always pleased! I order the same size every time and it always fits!
9789806442,4.0,Ordered this jacket as a gift to myself.  Had seen it in the Tommy Bahama retail stores at a crazy hight price.  Saw this on Amazon - saved over $200 off Suggested Retail Price.  It's a great leather jacket for the money!!!
978980685X,1.0,I was very taken aback by this product. First of all, it looked quite unflattering on me. The product description said, &#34;One size fits most,&#34; but no one ever told me it was made just for women. Secondly, I was surprised that when I put it on, I could still see my nipples. I didn't realize this of course until I was half way to the McDonalds in my matching g-string and lace gloves, when someone in a moving car yelled something about my nipples being the size of dinner plates. I had naturally assumed by the advertisement photo that this would somehow be covered up, but no! there were my big, pink chesticles for all to see. Sufficed to say, sitting in the McDonalds and devouring my five super sized Big Macs, I felt quite embarrassed.
9789810474,4.0,Like other shorts of this brand, the fit and fabric are great.  However, this style has pleated pockets that are the same height as the knobs on our kitchen cabinets and they catch all the time.  We we'll be stitching the pleats down so they don't get caught anymore.  Otherwise, great shorts.
9789812442,5.0,This is a beautiful shirt that can be worn from a casual dinner to a wedding.  Its high quality and always looks great on.
9789812442,5.0,it's a tommy  OK
9789813473,5.0,Quality, fit and attention to detail is why I continue to purchase Tommy Bahama apparel. Sizing is accurate, non fading and works great for causal or dress.
978981366X,4.0,This is a good quality Tommy Bahama shirt, but unlike the other Bahama shirts I own of the same size this one seems to run a bit long (about 2-3 inches longer than my other size Large Tommy Bahama shirts.  Other than that it is a great shirt, typical of Tommy Bahama products.  Just be prepared to see a tailor and have it shortened a little bit, after that it looks great.
9789814232,5.0,Very nice shirt as all Tommy Bahama clothing is. Good silk, very detailed embroidery for the back of the shirt's TB Design. I have many of these and, although i've found far better prices at the brick and mortar store sales, what you want is often not available if you wait too long. So, I'm going to go with, "I saved gas" , and be happy that I made an good environmentally conscious move. Don't worry, be happy!  LOL
9789814259,1.0,It looks nice and all but it don't fit. I understand I put on a few pounds but this shirt should have fit and it doesn't and in no way is that my problem
9789814259,4.0,I love these shirts both for the look and the comfort. My only complaint is the price. This shirt is fairly thin and delicate and probably made in Thailand. I doubt it will last more than a couple years. As of this review, the standard price for this shirt (anywhere) is approx. $80.
9789814607,5.0,Good color and very comfortable.
978981528X,5.0,I bought the shirt for my husband's birthday.  Pathetic shirt hangs perfectly for his body shape.  I liked it so much I ordered another one in a different color
9789815573,5.0,I love tommy bahama shirts. This one fits me great and I love the way it looks. Wear it to work with black slacks.
9789816723,3.0,By the look of the labeling and the button at the back of the collar, this appears to be old stock, not newly made.  I was surprised and disappointed.
9789817924,5.0,great product
9789841655,4.0,This was a gift which I sent to Singapore. The recipient loved it and It is just as I had expected it to be : style wise and in craftsmanship
9800531750,5.0,Have ordered many Tommy Bahama items from this seller. they always arrive promptly, new with tags, and exactly as described. i wouldn't order this brand name from anyone else.
982030332X,4.0,Tommy Bahama's clothing is top quality material with mature design. This shirt fits very well and looks even better on me...
9820303354,5.0,At the risk of being accused of being a shill for this seller, can't help it if i enjoy their Tommy products that i keep re-ordering. Seriously, everything from them arrives exactly as promised, thanks again!
9822490682,5.0,The shirts are great.They make perfect presents, for birthdays or the holidays.The shirts are comfortable easy to care for.
9822494750,5.0,This is as usual, a comfortable and stylish silk shirt I love to wear.  Would like to get more styles from Tommy in silk.
9822497415,5.0,We got this for a Birthday gift, and our friend loved it.
9822502885,5.0,I bought this shirt for my husband for Christmas.  As always with Tommy Bahama, it is beautiful. Fits true to size.
9822504365,5.0,Hubby loves Tommy Bahama - So this shirt I bought him as an xmas gift.  He loved it!!  And he loved the design, too!!!  Def Recommend!  Bought two TB shirts - Would buy from again!!
9822504462,5.0,Love the color, love the feel, love the flowing and elegant style. I've worn it for two lectures and gotten great compliments on the look!
9828378779,5.0,Fantastic &#34;go to&#34; shirt for those warm summer nights ... my son-in-law was very pleased, as was my daughter!  Terrific quality at a great price.
9828384647,5.0,The silk is so soft and it is the size is correct. I can't wait for this gift to be opened and worn for Christmas
9828384728,5.0,I bought this as a christmas gift for my son-in-law. Very nice leather jacket,  Unfortunately, it was too small and I returned it. Seller was easy to work with both on both ends.
9828397331,5.0,These are the best shirts made.  I love them.  There easy to wash and very comfortable.  Everyone makes a comment about them.
9830019934,4.0,The quality is Tommy B worthy and the material gives it a little more variety than the typical silk shirt. Great color!
9830030296,5.0,great design  comfortable  great for the new white,  gray is the new white  for jeans dudes
9830031993,5.0,Very summery. Nice fit with drawstring on inside if needed. These are linen but can be washed and dried at home, you might not get all the wrinkles out, but you would just wrinkle them in the same way when you put them in. I pretty much dry clean everything and these come out in pristine shape that way. But it is definitely not a necessity by any means.Just buy and enjoy the compliments!!!
9830032035,3.0,Fit it a tad off, but not bad.
9830033864,5.0,it a great looking shirt  a real eye catcher  it goes for the same price as in the store  on sale
9830034321,5.0,Got immediate head-turns and compliments on the shirt...esp the color...The quality is superb and the price was right. I will buy more or these in similar colors.
9861137882,1.0,Unfortunately I did not get a ring. I sent some book, which do not need. the money is returned back, But I'm not satisfied with.
9881716179,3.0,It took an awfully long time to get this outfit, which i expected, just wish I could have been more happy when I finally got it. The only thing about the outfit i can really use is the socks. I guess my hips are just too big for this outfit. It zips up rather than stretches, which for a one size fits most outfit, isn't a very good idea. Then the top was just ridiculous, NOT for the busty. I'm a 34D or DD and man, my boobs didn't even look good in this because the were so squashed. And the button that goes around the neck damn near choked me. I did manage to get some good photos in this outfit, but it's def not going to be used for anything but pictures. I would also say don't be fooled by this seller saying that it comes in a XXL and such, because I found this very same out fit sold by a seller on ebay for much less, and it's clearly a one size fits most Asians outfit. Here is the link to the outfit: [...] check it out for yourself, don't get ripped off, even if you are a smaller, less curvy woman and want to try this outfit.
9881716179,4.0,I got this for my GF. It is cute. But the real product does not look exactly the same as shown on the picture. But no big deal.
9881716179,4.0,I had bought this for a cosplay outfit I was wearing for a anime convention I was so anxious to get this overall I thought it was very cute. I don't think it was worth it's price nor did I think the skirt was the best but like I said cute item to buy for cosplay or dress up.
9882105602,1.0,I was duped by that picture. The material is cheap. The look is cheap. The packaging is nice. Don't buy that dress. If u want that dress take a scrap cloth and cut it up. I may look better than that dress. I will never wear it. Its really really really low class. It also takes forever to reach. Poor poor poor service. Poor
9888999117,4.0,They are very soft and comfortable to wear.  Some disappointment because they are definitely NOT skinny asadvertised.  Once again I failed to get skinny leather pants that I really want but other than that they are prettycool pants.
9889832488,5.0,I bought this for my friend, he loved it and he even uses it for school to carry all of his books.
9889832488,4.0,The bag itself is average quality, and it's very cute! It shouldn't be carrying too much, though - the material isn't that thick, and the strap isn't really reinforced or comfort guarded.
9889832488,5.0,First,the shipping was great. It came all the the way from Hong Kong. The estimated shipping was July 19-23rd but came on June 22nd. I haven't actually used it yet, but it's great. It's a normal sized messenger bag,same size as my other, so it'll be great for school. It'll be able to carry a binder and a textbook with some folders. Maybe it's just the computer screen, but the blue is not bright. It's Miku's teal color. Other than it, it's a great a price and bag.
9895501900,5.0,My wife loves it so I gained some points - it is well made and goes well with many of her outfits.
9895503776,5.0,It came before time , that i do love and it looks great too ..
9895503792,3.0,They look relatively cheap but not too bad. The disappointment was I thought these where tubes that looked like scrolls but the design is only on one side so it if slips over its a concave metal piece it doesnt look very good
9895515510,1.0,These were terrible.  Broke the first day wearing them.  I guess you get what you pay for. Would not recomment.
9895516312,5.0,I love it because its my team! The wooden tip connecting to the umbrella doesn't look too promising but I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  Love the look and feel of it... HALA MADRID!
9895517319,2.0,The black knitted hat was not what I ordered.  I thought I was getting a childs small .  It was returned
9895517319,5.0,my grandson was bugging me for this hat because when i take him to school, his face gets cold, especially after it snows.  he loves it and wears it constantly.
9895517319,3.0,Got these for the kids to sled with. They really can't see that good with them on so I the primary purpose has been defeated. However they will come in handy for just being  in the cold.
9895517319,1.0,Both hats purchased are starting to come apart between the eyes after less than a month. Both have only been worn 3 or 4 times. Contacted Amazon and was told the vendor would be contacted. Well, it's over a week now and still have not heard anything. Guess I'm stuck with this junk.
9895517319,4.0,A durable knit head/neck covering that will look good with proper care (use a small hosiery bag and warm water to machine wash).  The mouth area could be a bit wider for those of us with generously sized lips...hard to talk or get a quick bite without taking it off.
9895517319,5.0,Love it. My son thinks he is a superhero now. As soon as he put it on he said Mom I'm Blaine from Lego City Bateman.
9895517319,5.0,Great for eliminating Dirt, Dust & Sand whilw Quad, a little warm in the Summer, but Excellent during the Cooler Seasons.
9895517890,2.0,The look of the ear muffs from the picture fine. The fit is not. They are too small to wrap around the head and then they aren't snug.
9895517890,1.0,They can't fit any human being's head. These ear muffs are probably made for a kitty or a goldfish. So small and uncomfortable.
9895517890,4.0,I like them fine, they are comfortable, and serve the purpose.  However even though they fit me fine they were too small for my husband.  Therefore, I would recommend them for the average size woman or a youth but not for the average size man.
9991122052,4.0,I'm not Catholic, but I wanted a protection bracelet and this one was nice looking and the band is made up of fishing line or something. That is good because it makes the product last a long time. Mine broke unfortunately, but someone says that is a sign it did it's job, lol. I like to think of it that way, but I don't know if I would spend that much money on another one. I did get a lot of compliments on it also. If your Catholic your like it a lot, if your not and just want a "protection" charm, this will help you out.
B000000IJZ,5.0,If you want to know where glassjaw got their sound... listen to these guys...
B000000YFH,4.0,Mambo is Cuban, NOT Mexican music.  It was the most popular Cuban rhythm (cha cha cha is a type of mambo), and salsa was the result of the experimentation in the US of Latin jazz and Latin fusion.  Cal Tjader was one of the most influential practitioners of Latin jazz, and although he himself was not Latin, his music sounds just as authentic as that of Tito Puente and Ray Barretto.  Although some of the covers on this album sound like, well, covers; other tracks, like Guachi Guara (later titled Soul Sauce), Tjader's composition Mambo Macumba, and Fascinating Rhythm, have a fresh, authentic sound that will get you dancing.  This is much more than just a cover album, and suitable for true Latin fusion fans.
B000000YFH,5.0,I really like this cd for our Friday night patio dinners around the palm trees it sets the mood for a great dinner party for sure
B000000YFH,5.0,Count Basie once was asked to define &quot;swing&quot;. &quot;It's music meant to make a dead man tap his feet&quot;. Whew, this album is a total gas. Swining salsa rhythym  messed up in great Jazz standards that will make you tap your toes and shake whatever else you got going, brilliantly recorded sound and Jazz cooking on a slow burn,Mama!
B000000YFH,5.0,I read a review to BUY any Cal Tjader on Fantasy Record Label. I did and am very pleased.Great groove. Hummable melodies. Joyous music. It will heal your inner soul. I actually purchased this and 3 others.....
B000000YFH,4.0,I can't give this album five stars, even if it's funny. I think all of you already know Cal Tjader, vibist, jazz and latin player. Here you'll find both these styles mixed up in one of his earlier efforts. The year is one of the good ones, 1954. The enthusiasm is there, the music is light, not pretentious entertaining fifties orchestra music. The program consists more or less only in standard tunes here with mambo, latin arrangements. The music is light, unpretentious, funny, the tunes are short and kept simple and the solos are short and focused too. The orchestra arrangements not much elaborated. This record is not essential but it's a funny listening anyway. Or better, it may be essential but only for the cool fifties cover because sometimes the music turn to mexican flavour and .. you know, mexican music is not the coolest thing in the universe!
B000000YFH,5.0,My first encounter with Tjader was when he was the drummer for early Dave Brubeck trio recordings. Fast forward to 1954 and he had developed his distinctive style on vibes as heard on this album (he also plays timbales on some tracks here.)Listen to the sound samples on this page and you will hear how amazingly well Cal assimilated Afro-Cuban rhythms. Indeed, he had mastered a number of genres, but the flavor on these tracks echo George Shearing's influence on him, as well as other sources. For example his friend, bassist Al McKibbon, exerted a great deal of influence on Cal to immerse himself in this genre, which opened doors to other like minded musicians. McKibbon is not on this album, but the line-up clearly shows why the music on this album is true to form: Manuel Duran on piano, Carlos Duran on bass and dditional percussion by Edgard Rosales, Bayardo Velarde and Luis Miranda.This album is This is credited as Cal Tjader's Modern Mambo Quintet. It was recorded in San Francisco in September 1954 for Fantasy Records. For me this stands as one of the better examples of Cal's professional evolution because the arrangements and the performances on this album foreshadow some of his best later work.
B00000452O,3.0,The CD is good and original but not what I was looking for. I try to find historical Hurdy Gurdy music from around 1500.Just cannot find it. Let me know if you have that. And I will buy it
B00000452O,5.0,This is really a great CD -- even if you are new to this genre.  I recommend it wholeheartedly!!!
B00000452O,5.0,Nigel Eaton is one of the great hurdy gurdy players of our time. He's recorded widely in popular (remember Page and Plant?) as well as classical performances. This is a well-rounded selection of 18th century and beyond--not to be missed by any music lover.
B00000755K,5.0,I own all of this bands albums, but this was the best.  It is pure funk and it is classic.
B00000755K,5.0,This funky sophomore release solidified Klymaxx as the vain and sassy divas of funk. I would only wish that SOLAR's CEO, Dick Griffey had promoted this album more because this album was so hot that it's still burning after almost 30 years with sassy selections, "Wild Girls" and "Heartbreaker" thus putting Never Underestimate the Power of the Woman album to great shame.  Those two songs were the very first songs that Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis produced as well as the very first songs in their long 30 year resume although they were not hit singles. Lakeside-like highlights include the ballads "Convince Me" and "An Offer I Can't Refuse" to balance out their bad girl image while they boogie down with the infectious title track and "Don't Hide Our Love". Jam and Lewis also cooked up the slightly toned down "The Man in My Life" and retain their sassiness with the defiant, "All Turned Out"  Due to the fact that Mr Griffey focused more on Shalamar and The Whispers, this album was largely ignored as well the album has been crafted and it took the girls 2 more years to make themselves a household name with their massive hit album, Meeting in the Ladies Room.  Although the girls handled their own instruments (with some help), the production was all handled by either Jam & Lewis or Lakeside (except that Bernadette Cooper co-produced "Heartbreaker") which was probably a good thing to avoid overkill.  Although this was Klymaxx's prestardom period, I do consider this their best effort in my opinion (only ahead their next output and commercially their best selling one).  I highly recommend Girls Will Be Girls for any 80s R&B fan.
B00000755K,5.0,This is the 2nd album from the all-girl 80's Funk band, Klymaxx.Although it didn't sell very well where it wasn't promoted very well, it unites the original Divas of Funk with Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis and features some of the very first music produced by Minneapolis' Flyte Tyme Productions.  There are four Jam & Lewis cuts here and they are the first single, "Wild Girls," which in itself should have been HUGE, the rappin and sassy, "Heartbreaker (I'm Such A Mess)," the humorous, "All Turned Out" and the bouncy and perky closer, "The Man in My Life."  These songs in themselves make for an incredible dancing/funkin' musical experience.  The title cut is pretty tight too as is the rest which is comprised of some nice ballads for slow dancin'.This would be the album which would precede their monstruous 3rd album, "Meeting in the Ladies' Room," which would make Klymaxx a household name with its title cut and hit single, "The Men All Pause," its HUGE Pop ballad, "I Miss You" penned by percussionist, Lynn Malsby, and one last time with Jimmy & Terry on the tight, "Lock and Key."  You canNOT go wrong with EITHER of these two albums!
B00000DTG5,5.0,This is an unexpected treasure.  Carla Bley &amp; Steve Swallow join musicians from Sicily in a set dedicated to Carla's compositions.  And there are several absolute gems in here...a thoroughly entertaining version of &quot;Lone Arranger&quot; (with the dialogue sections spoken in Italian!) and a funky, laconic &quot;Egyptian&quot;.  The real standout, though, is an achingly beautiful version of &quot;Dreams So Real.&quot;  This is worth the price of the CD alone...it begins with a guitar voicing the melody and just swells from there....incredible solo work as wellWhile the arrangements aren't always very different from those on Carla's own CDs (Dreams So Real is one very notable exception), the band digs into each with joy, energy and enthusiasm.  A really remarkable CD!
B00000HF2Z,5.0,I've heard lots of pianists who can nail every note.  But Bronika brings a subtle yet discernible passion to her playing that makes a difference.Thoughtful rather than showy in her interpretations, Bronika's playing is simply a joy to listen to.
B00000HF2Z,5.0,This pianist has a beautiful touch and is a very talented young lady. I was drawn to her work by hearing her performances on [...]  where she has uploaded over seventy of her engaging performances for people to listen to, a wide variety of the classical and romantic repertoire.Bronika deserves much success and I wish her well in her recording and performance career.
B00000IG4O,5.0,For those of us who have been there, this album, and Aloha 592 especially, will always have a special place in our hearts.  The music excellent and tells of special aspects of life on J.I.
B00000IG4O,5.0,Great album Larry, it sure brings back the memories of the Six years spent on the island especially JI Sat. night.Sonny Hubler
B00000IG4O,5.0,Great CD!!! Highly recommended to any past JI resident.  "JI Saturday Night", "Island Boy", and "Aloha 592" are wonderful.TerryCAC First Sergeant (2000-2001)
B00000IUYP,5.0,Love it!  I love its natural materials, and I love that my son will be able to use it different ways as he gets older.We got it for him 5 months ago for his 1st birthday.  It came together fairly easily.  Right now he just runs in there and "hides" every once in a while, but I anticipate that it'll be a part of creative play, plus just some personal space for him, as he gets older.We haven't done any painting yet - I figure that'll be a project in a few years.
B00000IUYP,4.0,While overall, this is a really nice product, the measurements are a bit deceiving. The 6' measurement is from the floor to the top of the poles that you see sticking out from the top of the tee pee. This looks a lot larger than it actually is. We bought it to decorate and auction off for my daughter's kindergarten's project in their silent auction, and we really wish we'd gone for the next size up. This is fine for a small child, but hardly enough room for playing.
B00000IUYP,4.0,This tipi was easy to set up, and more important - easy to collapse and transport.  It is lightweight but sturdy, and the fabric is substantial.  One caveat:  since there is no anchoring system, the tipi easily slides around on a hard surface, which causes it to nearly collapse at times.  I do not anticipate that this will be a safety problem, however, since the product is all PVC and canvas.  Overall, a good buy, and more fun and visually appealing than a cheap tent!
B00000IUYP,5.0,The tee pee is really fun!  We've had it since my son was about 8 months old.  He used to sit in there with a book and all his stuffed animals.  At three you can still find him playing in there.  We never painted it because I think it will be a nice project for him to do when he is older.  It's very sturdy and well made.  I anticipate using it for years to come.  Keep in mind that it is quite large so you want a large area.
B00000K3SI,3.0,I love this bag. The design is nice, the egronomics are great, and the  price is right. However, I have found a few flaws with the bag during my  short tenure.First off, the notebook sleeve is padded on the front, two  sides, and the bottom. There is no padding for the back. While the back is  normally resting on your lower back, I find that in cases where the bag is  set down on the floor a little hard, damage may result from this lack of  padding in this area. Although this is easily fixed by a piece of syrofoam,  I don't see how such an obvious oversight came to be.The second minor  flaw is a missing handstrap. Although the shoulder strap is great for  resting on your shoulder, the longer length makes it a poor handstrap. A  handstrap along the top of the bag would be incredibly handy for just  picking it off the seat next to you, or off the floor for a short walk the  next room, saving the time of heaving it up and slinging it over your  shoulder.Lastly, despite claims to the contrary, this bag will not cut  it for a student, and especially a college student. There is simply not  enough capacity for books and materials. I feel that you can accomdate a  notebook, four medium size books standing up on end, along with a small  assortment of writing utensils. However, the bag at this point is fairly  maxed out, and leaves little room for expansion and other items your work  or your computer may need, such as a mouse and power supply or paper and  files.
B00000K3SI,5.0,Four years ago, I bought this messenger bag. Way back then, I gave it a stellar review. Now, the earth has been around the sun 4 times since then. I've also changed jobs, finished college, moved, and done more traveling than anyone should have to. Suffice it to say, everything in my life has changed. Except this bag. Since the day I got it, I've carried my amazon.com  bag and loved it because nobody else had one, and it was internet Kitsch. What  I discovered over 4 years was that this bag cannot and will not die. Its been dropped out of moving cars, attacked by a dozen hyper kittens, microwaved, worn when snowboarding, urinated on&lt;don't ask> and used to transport everything from homework to a small child.Now, despite all my amazon.com bag has been through, it still looks clean and fresh. I just toss it in the wash and let it drip dry, and it looks brand new, all over again. Similar bags from Crumpler, Chrome, Timbuk2, and ManHattan Portage easily sell for between $$$$$. I bought my amazon bag for $$$ on a fluke cause I needed a messenger bag. Every other messenger bag I own, was measured up against this one. They all come close, but none can touch my personal favourite. The day this bag finally dies, if ever, the only thing I'll wish for, in regard to my amazon.com bag, is that they hadnt stopped selling them, so I could buy another.
B00000K3SI,4.0,This bag is a great bargain (though I got it as a gift).  There aretons of great little pockets here and there...even one to put my cell phone in.  As for putting a laptop in there, I had problems putting my big Dell Inspiron in there...though it does fit but it's tight. Another work laptop I have--also a Dell but a bit smaller and probably more the size of the average laptop fits in there perfectly.  It's fairly comfortable and fits a lot.  It's a kind of heavy bag to begin with...so if you use it as makeshift gym bag or beach bag, a simple towel and some CDs makes it heavier than you'd probably want.
B00000K3SI,4.0,I don't like briefcases and I'd rather use my backpack for hiking.I use the messenger bag for work all the time. I haven't used it on my bike but  it is extremely comfortable.  I carry my laptop, PDA, and files with me.  There are plenty of pockets. Don't overstuff it or else you will have a  hard time closing it and carrying it around.It has a quality feel and  the stitching is very good.  The flap is waterproof and has a strap to  mount a blinking LED bike light.  The laptop holder is padded and has a  clip strap to keep it from falling out.  The cellphone pocket is a little  small.  It has a nice key clip but my keys jingle a lot when I use it.  The  outer drink holder works well for pop cans and water bottles.I wish it  had an additional hand carrying strap but so far I can live without it.
B00000K3SI,5.0,I don't carry a laptop; I have enough problems with one desktop at home and four at work.  BUT wrap some &quot;blue ice&quot; in a towel and put it and a sandwich, etc. in the laptop compartment, and I've got a  semi-insulated lunch bag -- along with plenty of room for everything else.  For some reason, I carry half of my possessions back and forth to work each  day.  At this time of year, this bag is almost perfect.  I hate to say the  price is a steal, but....the price is a STEAL.
B00000K3SI,4.0,I'm not a biker but bought the bag anyways, because I needed a cool, handy bag to carry my PowerBook, PDA and loads of other stash.I find it very  cool indeed and pleased that my PowerBook fits snugly inside. (at times I  wonder if it was designed for the PowerBook)My only qualm is that the  awkard top bit of the flap folds up when u carry it. I'm sure that there  could be a workaround.Other than that, I love the bag. It's brilliant  and it's got Amazon.com on it! Yippeeee!
B00000K3SI,5.0,The bag's very, very nice and absolutely great for biking around with. These messenger bags are much better than backpacks because they don't put any direct weight on your spine when you are biking.Great features of  the Amazon.com bag: A waist strap prevents slippage, a comfy shoulder pad,  plenty to room for all your stuff without being too bulky, a pocket for  cellphone/pens, a really nifty internal laptop compartment which you can  also use to store files, an external net pocket to stash a water bottle or  any other small item, and nice safety features- 2 reflective strips and a  loop for your safety blinker light.A word of caution about the two  reflective safety strips. Becasue they are secured by detachable clips, do  be careful when fiddling to open or close the bag - You may indavertantly  unfasten the wrong clips and lose the reflective strips. To ensure that  this doesn't happen you could tape up these clips.Aside from this minor  point, this is a GREAT bag. Get it!
B00000K3SI,5.0,The bag is very comfortable and easy to tote (I'm a bus, rather than bicycyle, traveller), and the convenience of the pockets and divisions is excellent. I use it to carry books, files, and other teaching materials, and its construction relieves the pressure on my less-than-perfect back. Highly recommended.
B00000K3SI,5.0,My lovely and delightful roommate bought this for me as a birthday present, and it is wonderful!  Roomy, very well-constructed, and with lots of pockets for all of my accoutrements.  It is larger than I had originally anticipated, but that is an extra added bonus.  Ideal for a weekend trip, or for dragging all of your goodies to and from work.  It is aesthetically pleasing as well, with the all-black waterproof matierial and slightly silverish piping that is reflective for safety.  The shoulder strap pad is great-with a grippy substance on the underside that holds the strap just where you put it.  What a great present!
B00000K3SI,5.0,This bag looked great and now that i've used it for several days, I love it. I've been looking for a 'general use' bag forever. I needed a bag that could act as a carry all and as a book bag, and laptop bag. Its great.  Someone commented i think, on the weight distribution. It all depends on  hwo you load the bag. I was carrying at least 25 lbs. in books today all  day and it was fine. Also all the neat little pockets are wonderfull. Room  for everything you need. Only one little complaint, My Sprint PCS Gen 1  phone is a little too tall for the cell pouch, but otherwise, Great!
B00000K3SI,5.0,I don't expect to ever have to buy another backpack/briefcase again.  This holds my Handspring Visor, cellphone, wallet contents, car stereo face, documents, and several books, and I hardly know it's there.  Much more  comfortable than any backback I've ever owned(with more pockets) and frees  up both hands for other things, unlike a briefcase. The drink pocket keeps  a water/soda bottle secure and easily accessible, and I get compliments on  the way it looks all the time.
B00000K3SI,5.0,I'm a daily bicycle/rollerblade commuter.  I usually overstuff this bag.  It fits comfortably and securely, especially with the ergonomic/adjustable shoulder and waist strap.  I live in the  Seattle area, so I really  appreciate the weather proofing.  Lots of compartments to separate my  personal and professional stuff.  Great detailing. I like the reflective  piping and the ext. flap loop to attach my tail light.  It would be nice to  have a carry handle-brief case like.  Otherwise, well-made, practical,  great value-outstanding.  I almost look like a real messenger.
B00000K3SI,5.0,Sexy messenger bag! What I look for in a bag is lots of useful pockets; this one has 'em. Removable key ring, mesh exterior pocket for my water bottle, interior pocket that seems custom fit for my cell phone...I love  it. Black color goes with my coffee, and the reflective piping keeps me  safe and stylee!
B00000K3SI,5.0,The reflectors are a thoughtful addition for people who travels a lot on a bike. Also I appreciate the extra pockets for the cellphone the PDA and the padded pocket inside for my laptop.
B00000K3SK,5.0,Being young, and having my own business, its important to me to have something to carry all of my business equipment and laptop in one easy to tote package.  I had almost given up my search on the ultimate portable  office, when I found this Amazon.com backpack.  Its WONDERFUL!  Its very  stylish and the blue is a very pretty color.  The cell phone attachment is  wonderful (could be a little but bigger in length) to have right there on  your shoulder, so you don't have to fumble around for your phone when it  rings.  There is a spacious padded slot for your laptop, a water bottle  mesh carrier is attached on the outside which is great here in HOT West  Texas, and the key ring is a must and works VERY well.  This is a WONDERFUL  product.  I've used it for almost a month and I wouldn't give it up for the  world.  Thanks Amazon.com!  You did a GREAT job with this one!  Great  sale price too!
B00000K3SK,4.0,I first bought your Messenger Bag and returned it. It was to large for what I was looking for. I then ordered your backpack. This is exactly what I need to commute back and forth to work. Large enough to carry my work,  lunch and portable cd player. Easy access to the organizer in the front.  Hangs on my shoulders very comfortably. Easy to remove and carry when in a  crowded train. I would recommend this backpack to my friends.
B00000K3SK,5.0,I could tell a long story of how the original parcel got robbed and how Amazon.com then managed to replace it just a couple days before my girl's birthday, but I won't. Everybody knows how they care for their clients and  how great their service is, I believe. Apart from these emotions it's worth  mentioning that the bagpack is really convenient and roomy for all  important things we have to carry with us. We all in our family liked it so  much, that now I'm seriously thinking about ordering another bag for  myself.
B00000K3SK,4.0,I've had my share of good and bad backpacks; so when I received it I decided to wait 5 months or so to give a fair review.  Well, the time has come and Im happy to say it has survived classic overload of books, the  continuous movement from one side of the campus to the other, and every  other  common event you can think of in the life of a student (and all  while carrying the laptop inside).  It's great...the shoulder straps are  very comfortable and feel very safe to pull on and off at any time.  However......it should have a thicker bottom pad for the laptop, for when  you let down the back pack on desk or floor (however softly) you can hear  the knock from that surface with the laptop.
B00000K3SK,5.0,I bought this backpack on Amazon Auctions and am gald I own it. There is space for a laptop, cellphone, pda, coffee mug ... you name it. I find it ideal for day-hiking. And its stylish (and compact) too, making it cool  enough for your work place.
B00000K3SK,5.0,PDA? Cell phone? Laptop? MP3 CD player? Wad of papers for work? Reading material? Cool Amazon logo that makes my co-workers think I'm way &quot;dot-com&quot;? Check to all of those. My world fits in this bag with room to spare. The cell phone case on the strap is pure genius. Zippers and velcro and click-buckles hold everything in place, but keep everything accessible - yet not so accessible that everything falls out. I cannot rave enough about this excellent bag. The downside? Amazon always seems to be out. If you're lucky enough to see the &quot;now available&quot; sign on, grab it. At the price, its simply amazing.
B00000K3SL,5.0,This bag really does hold everything! I don't have a laptop but that's not a problem because I use that section as a place to put things I need quickly or to put away safely like contact lense cases and stuff like that.  With the very handy clip for the keys, I'm not standing out in the rain  hunting for keys that have fallen to the bottom of the bag.  I would  seriously recommend this bag to anyone who needs a little more versatility  but wants a bag that wouldn't look out of place at work either.  One  particularly fine day, I managed to fit in books, a mini picnic and my  jacket and not once did my shoulder feel like it was about to break.  No  mean feat.  Buy it, buy it now!
B00000K3SL,5.0,I bought this bag thinking that for the price I would get a commuter tote with about a six month life.  Instead I got the perfect bag!  I use the notebook section to put books, magazines and a (paper)notebook.  I can then  fit anything in the main section, including a complete change of clothes.  For example, tonight I had two small notebooks, three magazines, my wallet  and checkbook, my cell phone and pager, cough drops, candy, a 15,000 page  credit manual, and seven file folders.  Plus pens and other junk.  The  straps are large enough to sling the bag over your shoulder so you can  center the weight a little more comfortably.  It also has a great key clip,  a convenient little pocket the perfect size for my train pass and access  card, and a roomy outside pocket for stuff you want to grab quickly.
B00000K3SL,5.0,After owning this wonderful roomy tote bag, I NEVER use any other pocketbook I own!  It has the padded compartment inside (for a laptop), but I use it to store bottled drinks and snacks to bring to work....and sometimes my 6 year old's toys when traveling.  I use the mesh pocket inside also. I store my pillbox inside and it's easy access for your lipstick.  I have banged it around for almost a year now and it looks brand new! The outside zippered pocket is big enough for my eyeglass case and cell phone. I'm buying 3 more for Christmas presents!
B00000K3SL,5.0,I love it and my co-worker was admiring it today. The price was right, it zips up on top and is just a great all around tote!
B00000K3SL,5.0,I initially purchased this tote because of the featured sale price, and I was so impressed with the size and durability of the tote, that I bought 3 more to give to fellow Mommies at Christmas!  This bag can hold everything you and your baby need while out for an entire day. I can pack extra clothes, pajamas, plenty of diapers, food and toys.  The compartments inside are an added bonus.  The wide straps make this tote extra-comfortable to carry over your shoulder.  The material is easy to clean with soap and water-- another plus!  I would recommend this tote at any price!
B00000K3SL,4.0,I am a graduate student with a daily commute on a train, and Ihave found this bag really useful to schlepp a lot of different-sizedcrap--books, water bottle, apples, usual girl paraphernalia, books, notebooks, pens, etc.  I have never carried both my laptop and books at the same time, but I think it would be possible without breaking my back.  The padded laptop &quot;envelope&quot; is definitely the best feature.  Most of the time, however, I use it to keep my small stuff from roaming around the bag.  Contrary to Eddie's review, this *is* a comfortable bag if you carry it on your shoulder.  It is too big to carry with your hands unless you are Wilt Chamberlin-sized or just have really short arms. (The straps aren't padded, but somehow they seem to work just fine.) It is also slightly more staid-looking than the picture would lead you to believe. The bag seems durable, but I wouldn't predict more than a 3-5 year lifespan. I tend to change bags frequently--always looking for the perfect book bag that will solve all of my problems--and have been really happy with it.  I would highly recommend it--and not just because it has a spiffy Amazon.com logo on it.
B00000K3SL,3.0,I searched the world over for a nice, inexpensive bag to bring to Japan, to be used as a carry-on for the plane, a purse, and an overnight bag, all in one trip.  I had a couple of problems.  First of all, the padding  intended to keep a laptop out of harms way takes up quite a bit of  unnecessary space, when a laptop is not being used.  Secondly, as a purse,  while easy to get into and out of (and water resistant, I might add!) the  straps are uncomfortable after being carried for more than an hour --  especially if there is anything of significant weight in the bag. But, on  the whole, I'm glad I bought the bag, and would do it again -- I'd just put  some padding on the straps before I left!  (fits nicely in the overhead  compartments of planes, trains, busses, etc.)
B00000K3SL,5.0,When I got my job as a librarian, one of the first things I noticed was  how many bags these people carry to and from work.  Six months into the  job, I needed one desparately as well!  This bag is wonderful because it  has a place for your notebook computer (alas, I use this space for my  library books!) and a zippered pocket inside (where I keep my cosmetics!)  plus a little &quot;net&quot; pocket where I keep things I need access to  quickly (my keys!).  It also has a zipper pocket outside where I keep my  pencils.  The bag has plenty of space, since it manages to carry my lunch,  all my books, my purse, and everything else I need to carry!  The straps  are just long enough to sling over my shoulder and just short enough that I  can carry it by hand if I want to.  I like the colors too; they are neutral  so they match pretty much everything I own.  The bag is my lifesaver; and  after about 6 months of hard use, it still shows NO wear!
B00000K3SL,5.0,This is a really good looking bag.  Appropriate for men or women.  I love the configuration of the interior.  I don't have a laptop, so the laptop compartment comes in handy for a number of uses.  It is a great place to  put a bottle of water.  I also use it to put my wet towel in after being at  the gym.  It helps to keep the other stuff dry.
B00000K3SL,5.0,I first bought this bag for my grandmother who loves to carry a tote bag rather than a pocketbook.  I was so surprised at the quality and roominess of the bag that I am going to order one for myself.  The section where a laptop should go could easily be used to keep bottles cool for a short time. I am going to use my bag as a diaper bag/purse.  It is a great bag for the price!
B00000K3SL,4.0,It's a bit large-then again I'm only 4'11&quot;,so everything is BIG for me. I don't have a laptop either,but I needed something that can hold alot of stuff (I carry everything but the kitchen sink,ya know?)and this tote/ purse can and does do it!And for the price they are selling it at right now--it is the best deal around!You cannot go wrong with this.
B00000K3SL,5.0,I do have to say,  I did not expect to get something THIS HUGE.  It's so roomy there is room for a lap top.  I plan to use it as a carry-on bag for travelling, so I can put all my books and extra things on the plane with me. It's perfect for travelling with all it's pockets and zippers.  It even has a key chain inside.I can see how a bag like this can be so versatile:  diaper bag; school book bag;  lap top bag for work.  It's great!  And the price is reasonable.  I thought it was a bargain!
B00000K3SL,5.0,Wow, I can't believe it's been 7.5 years that I've owned/used this bag!I bought two of them in November 2000 - one for me, one for my mom.  We both use them extensively.I keep wishing Amazon would bring it back!This tote holds EVERYTHING.  I haven't used it much as a laptop tote, but it works well for that.  Otherwise, the laptop pocket is great for transporting papers and magazines since that compartment is separate.  The outside pocket is roomy without things getting too lost into it, and there are extra hanging pockets inside the main compartment as well as a removable keychain clip.  The bag itself is lightweight but very durable.  It is awesome as an airplane carryon.This was a fabulous value at $5.95 when I bought it - worth well over that price.
B00000K3SL,5.0,I was surprised by the size of this bag--it's rather HUGE!  But, it looks pretty durable and the price is definitely unbeatable!  This would be a nice tote to carry around while traveling or just to carry around books.  There is alot of room to fit whatever you desire.  There's also the laptop compartment which could be used for other stuff, rather than a laptop.  The colors (it's actually a grayish and black color) are easy to match with any outfit.  Other than the fact that it's a bit too big, it's a very inexpensive, durable, and versatile tote bag!
B00000K3SL,5.0,I was pretty skeptical before buying this, but the review are all great, so i tried.And this is A VERY GOOD STUFF: I can put my dell notebook there and some books, plus a few shirts to tavel overnight. I even use to  to go to office.This is just the good bag i need. VERY HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED.
B00001NFV8,1.0,Very disappointed in the quality for the price. Cheaply made. Face mask and shin guards made out of brittle plastic.
B00001NFV8,4.0,This costume was true to size and included the jumpsuit, shin guards and mask.  The headpiece is a mask and not a helmet. The elastics were not securely connected on the shin guards, so we ended up having to pin them on.  But my son was thrilled with his authentic looking motocross racer costume!
B00001NFX5,4.0,This costume is so cute, I can't wait for Halloween! It fits perfectly, my son is 18 lbs. The only thing I didn't see anyone else mention is that the material is very shiny. I didn't expect that, but overall it is great!
B00001NFX5,5.0,I purchased this costume for my 16 month toddler.  He is tall for his age (but on the thin side) so it was a little short, but I got lion style socks and little moccasins so that it was not even noticeable and he looked adorable.  The tail was a little too high.  My son was very comfortable in the costume and absolutely loved wearing it.  We had lots of fun on Holloween.  He still wears the Mane/bonnet to play lion around the house.  I would recommend this to a friend.
B00001NFX5,3.0,The costume was cute, but super thin material.  You could see through the bottom part of the costume.  We weren't expecting too much for this price.
B00001NFX5,5.0,We wanted him to have something that would be easy to put on, easy for him to run around in and be stinking adorable. This costume is all of that in more. He loves it and mom loved the price tag!Size help-Our son is 14 months ,40% in size and it fits perfect. I do not think it would fit a 18 month old as stated.
B00001NFX5,1.0,Okay, this is flimsy material. The velcro tail detaches itself easily and the whole costume folds up as the material naturally curls. It's a nice one off costume but nothing more.
B00001NFX5,4.0,I like the costume!  It is exactly what I wanted.  The shipping took forever! It was a week before the item was shipped.  They did not offer tracking either.
B00001NFX5,3.0,It is not a great costume but it isn't bad either. The fabric is comfortable and it was easy to dress my baby. It is what it cost me so it's ok.
B00001NFX5,4.0,This costume is nearly perfect - it is very cute, the design makes the "mane" stay in place but out of your kid's face. The tail is removable, which is nice. The outfit breathes so your kid will not overheat. It is sized small.My only gripe with it is that it does not have a bottom opening for diaper changes. (Also, though I loved it, I had to send mine back as it was obviously someone's return - but if I had had time to wait for an exchange, I would definitely have gotten another!)
B00001NFX5,5.0,I didn't want to spend a lot for a costume, and this costume is a great value! All of the removable parts, including the tail and the string that ties around the child's chin for the lion "mane" attatch with a velcro dot. This makes it safe, especially the mane bonnet, for a yound child. The costume is durable- it went through the wash twice before Halloween. Very well made and good for a 12 month old!
B00001NFX5,3.0,You definately get what you pay for with this costume. I bought it for my son and it was cute on him and he had fun being a lion. But it is VERY thin (I had to put clothes on him underneath the outfit) and VERY shiny. Cheap material. Three stars out of five because it is not that expensive and gets the job done.
B00001NFX5,3.0,Nothing special about this costume.  It's not high quality but the price was right for a toddler costume that was only worn twice for a few hours.  It's very thin and flimsy but was perfect for a warm Halloween night. Shipped in reasonable amount of time.
B00001NFX5,2.0,Material is too thin, would be good for a warmer climate. My baby wears size 12 months but this barely fits him. Have to return it.
B00001NFX5,1.0,The head piece looks so cheap, and the mane lays flat, no matter what you do. Its very cheap, and they won't give you a refund either. I really think they are misleading us by putting a picture of a nicer costume but actually selling you the super cheap one. Amazon should step in and say the picture must match the product recieved. Regardless of price, you should get whats pictured, or clearly state its not.
B00001NFX5,5.0,Fantastic price. Adorable costume for the price.  Costume does run very small.  Just slightly big for my grandson who is wearing 6 mos sizes.
B00001NFX5,4.0,I got this costume for my 9month old, he was 20lbs and it fit him perfectly.  We liked that the material was not too thick, but still pulled off the look.
B00001O36O,5.0,The only negative thing about the costume was that it wasn't the highest quality. There ended up being a hole in the &#34;mommy&#34;. Otherwise, it was a lot of fun, everyone thought it was hilarious.
B00001O36O,5.0,This costume is exactly as depicted.It was not a disappointment at all, it is absolutely hilarious and the illusion is great! I am extremely happy with the item and how it is made!
B00001O36O,1.0,Merchandise came as an open package. eventhough it stated that it is new. Inflatable legs have a whole in them and don't work. tried calling the vendor several times, but end up placed on hold for more than 30 minutes without being able to talk to anyone. Paid top dollars for shipping to make sure I recieve it in time, and end up getting a bad/damaged item. I don't recommend dealing with this vendor.
B00001O36O,4.0,This costume was great and my son got so many laughs wearing it.NOt a costume for a shy person because it gets soooo much attention.A costume for someone who wants a lot of looks and laughs.Would have given it 5 stars but the mask was a little bit disapointing,not very realistic.
B00001O36O,1.0,Everything mentioned was included in the costume kit and looked as advertised. However, both the inflatable parts of the costume had holes in them upon arrival. They were not fixable!
B00001O36O,5.0,This is one of the best costumes I've ever seen.  I bought it 5 years ago, and won the same Halloween contest 3 years straight wearing this costume.  It kinda helps since my nickname is BeerChild though.  Note:  If you have a beer belly like I do, the torso on grandma sticks out a bit and kinda looks funny.  The inflatable torso and legs are made of a decent thickness of material, so they can take some punishment.  I lost my granny to a cigarette though :-(
B00001O36O,5.0,this costume basically paid for itself.  i wore it to work and won the prize money for the costume contest!!  then i wore it to another party and won first prize there!!  everyone gets a huge laugh when they see it and i can't help but grin myself when i look in the mirror.  the mommy's face is a little on the cheap/scary side but with two prizes under my belt, i got nothing to complain about :)
B00001O36O,4.0,I received the costume without the bonnet!  Would have to return the whole costume, can't get a replacement for the bonnet!Otherwise, It would be a great find!  Now I have to find a bonnet!
B00001O36O,1.0,Totally disappointed . This air balloon parts coming with tinny holes' it ruined my celebration , I can't use it for my Halloween party  ,after I spent $50.00  its not worth it at all. I want my money back ASAP.Never again.
B00001O36O,3.0,This costume got lots of laughs. But the blow up legs only lasted one night and developed two holes that leaked out all the air. The costume is a tight fit also. I'm a small guy (5'6" 160 lbs) and I barely squeezed into it. Also needs a better looking old lady mask, the one it comes with is really cheap looking.
B00001O36O,5.0,Super funny.....had tiny holes in the legs but you can fix them with duct tape, my husband look great in it.
B00001O36O,1.0,This costume was funny but very poorly made.  My son wore it for 1 hour.  I would not hold air in either place.  It was received with a hold in one part which we patched but it still wouldn't hold air and we couldn't find any holes in the other piece that would not hold air.  The "mommy" part kept falling apart.  The clothing pieces were cheap and wouldn't stay on correctly either and the mask wasn't very realistic. It was VERY disappointing.  We had to go out on the day before Halloween as a result to buy another costume.
B00001O36O,5.0,thats a very funny custume for every ocasion,every one laugh a lot when see you with it
B00001O36O,3.0,The largest the costume came in was large. I think they should make one in XL. Not a costume for people with big bellies.
B00001O36O,1.0,This product was not only made from cheap material but it does NOT look like the picture. Unfortunately once you try on the costume, you are stuck and cannot return it. It was a waste of $40 and do not recommend getting this costume despite the other comments. Save yourself time and money!
B00001O36O,4.0,It was a great fit. Everything was in new and working condition. Was a hit at work with this costume!!! Fast shipping. A+++++
B00001O36O,1.0,The dummy or plastic portion of the costume started coming apart at the seams and the air leaked out. I started putting air into it and it leaked all over. i had to finally stuff it with socks. For the price it was horrible and not worth it. The idea of the costume was very good though.
B00001O36O,3.0,it was hilarious the first time I wore it but ended up falling apart the second time where I was put on stage at a bar and could have won $500. dang costume.
B00001O36O,1.0,Size is a bit smaller, my husband is xL i bought it and it verily fit him. It was ok to wear it inside the house and make the kids laugh but very uncomfortable to go out.Quality of the dress kind of cheap, you get what you see in the picture but we were afraid it might open or be thorn apart at any moment.
B00001O36V,1.0,Ordered this for my husband for a Halloween party this weekend.  My husband is 5'11 and weighs 175 pounds, jean size 34.  He is slim and could barely get the pants up over his hips.  In fact, the pants wouldn't even cover all of his butt and they were about 6&#34; above his ankles.  He didn't even bother trying the jacket on.  If you are a 12 year old string bean, these may fit.
B00001O36V,5.0,this arrived just as promised.  all the parts were in excellent condition.  my son had a great time wearing it.
B00001O36V,5.0,This was a big hit @ the 1st Halloween party I wore it at.  The pants were a bit small, which at first I thought was gonna drive me nuts, but I'd say more people got a kick out of my super tight blue high wader tights than anything else.  They all said &#34;Thats what makes the costume!&#34;  Either way, people loved it, and it was enjoyable to wear.
B00001O36V,1.0,Very cheap costume (material and work). Worst part is the pants are not made to fit an adult. There are similar costumes that are cheaper because they don't come with pants. They are the better deal since you can't wear the pants this one comes with. This is a one wear and done costume.
B00001O36V,4.0,It runs pretty small even though I bought the 42-46 size and my husband is a small guy.  The Costume is funny and I would say worth the money.
B00001O36V,2.0,All is fine except beware that the pants are about a female size 6, so plan accordingly. My boyfriend is a 36 waist and couldn't get these over his butt.
B00001O36V,1.0,I bought this for my husband who is 6'1 200lbs & wears a large to xl in shirts & 35/32 pant. I ordered him the Xl costume. We made the mistake of not opening it until Halloween night & boy, were we disappointed. I know most costumes are not the best quality but this thing is horrible. The fabric is so cheap, the sleeves on the jacket were tight in his upper arms/shoulders (like they would rip) & they were super short-abt 5 inches. When we pulled the pants out, we started laughing bc they looked like they'd fit me & I'm 5'2 108lbs. Needless to say, he had to improvise now that he was stuck w/out a costume.
B00001O36V,1.0,Didn't come with pants as was stated on the original posting. Was extremely disappointed to find out that they falsely advertised this product
B00001O36V,3.0,The pants wont fit anyone I know, let alone the listed size 42-46. No way! I wear a 44 to 46 and this was too small for me, I felt cramped in it all night.
B00001O36V,1.0,The largest size available was 42-46 - for an adult?  Most male adults would not be able to fit in this (I certainly could not), so I can only assume this was meant for small body types (adolescent to early adulthood)
B00001O36V,2.0,The Size XL 42-46 costume pants were too tight for a guy who wears a size 34 pant. Very disappointing.
B00001O36V,1.0,The costume is made from cheap quality material which is thin and does not hold it's shape. Also the pants were disproportionately small compared to the jacket. My son is 5'9&#34; and about 130 pounds, tall and slim. The arms on the jacket were slightly short but the body and shoulders of the jacket were wide and fell off the shoulders. The pants were so straight and narrow, my son could not even get them over his thigh to pull them all the way up. Also very short. I would not recommend this costume.
B00001O36V,1.0,I ordered size XL (42-46). The jacket was fine, what I expected. The pants! OMG the pants were TINY. My husband could not pull them up over his thighs and he is not heavy. The tag in the pants had been cut out. I measured them with a tape measure: they were 32 inches at the waist. The rise was a mere 11 inches from the inseam to the waist AND was the same measurement in the rear as the front! I actually split the seam deliberately so we could pull them up to see how high they would have come had they been large enough to get on. The fabric in the back did not cover much more than half of his butt. Again, we're not talking about a big, fat guy here. Normal size.The quality was poor overall but I expect that with a Halloween costume. What I do NOT expect is to have some tiny inventory overstock pants packaged deliberately with the as-advertised jacket with no regard for the unsuspecting customer who will obviously be getting only a jacket and a matching piece of blue flannel trash. The costume does not work with jacket alone and while I might have been able to sew in some extra material to fix the width of the pants, the rise killed it.I don't know if the merchant is to blame or the supplier but I spent $36 on an unwearable Halloween costume and I'm not pleased about it.
B00001O36V,3.0,For the same money, we could have rented this outfit.  Why not buy it.  No pockets though.  Could use 1.
B00001O36V,4.0,This was the best costume I have ever had. Very good quality, held up in the wash comfortable. I got it in plenty of time for my party. The size is inaccurate I am a 33 waist and 42 for a jacket and I just managed to get into the pants. The jacket fit like a glove if I was any bigger there is no way I would fit in it. Other than that great costume.
B00001O36V,2.0,I ordered the costume thinking I'd fit. I'm 5'9&#34;, 210lbs. The pants barely got halfway up my thighs. I wear a 38 waist normally so there's absolutely no way that the pants are any bigger than 32.
B00001O36V,5.0,I just got this costume and tried it on for my family, I've never seen my wife laugh so hard.  My daughter (who loves the Austin Powers movie)now thinks I'm the coolest dad around.  Although the quality of the costume itself isn't the greatest, what can you expect for the price? It is well worth it in laughs.  Also, if you get the costume, get the accessories that are sold seperately.  Now if I can just get my wife to get a Fembot costume. Happy Halloween, baby!
B00001O36V,3.0,Glad I got the size I  did.  It runs very small.  But it was a huge hit at the party. Went well with the Fembot costume my wife wore. We won best couples costume.
B00001O36V,1.0,It said the size would fit according to their sizing chart.  I'm 5'11&#34; 190....The pants would probably fit someone 5'7&#34; at 150lb
B00001O36V,1.0,This product was useless. I ordered an Adult Large...the jacket was about a Medium but still could wear, the pants would barely fit a toddler and there were no glasses. Definitely do not buy this product. You will just be returning it. This seller is very unprofessional and deserves no business. FYI,  I'm 5'11&#34;, 185lbs. 34&#34; waist.
B00001O36X,5.0,And it worked great. I just needed something I could alter a lot and turn into David Bowie during the scene where he and Sara are in the masquerade. This jacket served me well.
B00001O375,3.0,Good costume but the head piece was worse than I expected, and wish it was better because thats the most important part being bald.
B00001O375,4.0,As others have said, the fit is slimmer than standard. For reference: I am 6'3&#34; and usually wear M or L tees/sweatshirts. I ordered this costume in XL and it fit comfortably (i.e. not billowy). The length was also right-on: no dragging and no ankle-showing.The cloth of the shirt and pants is high quality. My only complaints are that there are no pockets and that the integrated shoulder pads are awkward. Fortunately, the elastic band is lenient enough that you can wear athletic shorts with pockets underneath to stash your stuff. And I'm sure you can remove the shoulder pads if you feel so inclined.The bald head wig is a shade of sickly yellow similar to latex gloves at a doctor's office. I can't imagine it would fit or look good. For most, this probably won't matter since if you're in the market for a Dr. Evil costume, chances are you're already bald.
B00001O375,3.0,Dr. Evil is supposed to be a little paunchy, but this costume doesn't allow for that.  Just be prepared if you aren't in grade school anymore.
B00001O375,2.0,I must admit that this costume very quickly caught my eye. I was always more a fan of Dr. Evil than of the international man of mystery. This costume was however a big disappointment. It has the quality of the pair of pants I sewed back in home economics in high school. It does look like Dr. Evil's suit, but so would and costume with that specific shade of gray. The quality isn't very great either, but you can't expect much from this price. All in all, if you're a really big fan of Dr. Evil and have to look like him, then by all means buy this. It's not a HUGE investment. However, if you like him, but don't love him, then this costume is more bad than evil.
B00001O375,5.0,Great custom!  It also isn't very expensive.  If your looking for a cheap, but good custom it is a good product.
B00001O375,1.0,not a quality costume by any stretch of the imagination. First the one size fits all isn't true of you're on the larger side, but more important the material doesn't breath so not wearable for any length of time.
B00001O375,4.0,I have a shaved head so the custome looked really good on me, lots of compliments. If you're not bald do note the bald cap it comes with is pretty cheap so don't rely on it. Overall it looks similar enough that I didn't need to explain who I was dressed as, which is a huge plus.
B00001O375,3.0,Met expectations which were in line for the price.  I worked fine for my need and I was not expecting a high end outfit.
B00001OGXJ,1.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! very poor quality, i would have been better off going to the 99 cent store. the teeth are flimsy rubber and have no way to 'mold' into your mouth. they will not stay in and you have a real chance of swallowing them, but you will likely take them out because they are very uncomfortable to wear. a complete waste of money and the worst product i have ever received from Amazon... the plastic glasses are again of extremely poor quality...
B00001OGXJ,2.0,The teeth won't stay in place.  The glasses are exactly what I expected.  S&H makes this item quite expensive. What a great business to be in -- Costumes & Accessories.  Buy your stuff from China for pennies on the dollar and charge 500% or more to the customer.
B00001OGXK,1.0,I bought this to go with the costume but the hair was not at all a match to the Austin in the movies.  It was really dark and even though we tried and tried to get it right by combing it ....it was a failure and my husband had to use his own hair what he has left of it...lol...The teeth were a little off also.  He only wore the glasses.
B00001OGXK,2.0,The glasses and the necklace were good, the teeth are kind of useless like mentioned before except for maybe taking a picture - the wig in NO WAY resembles Austin Powers' hair, it is way too dark and just not even the right shape/style.  It worked alright for my husband, but there are most likely alot better options out there.
B00001OGXK,1.0,When I received this kit it only contained the glasses and teeth despite the fact that it was advertised as a deluxe kit complete with the wig and medallion.  Needless to say I was very disappointed!  My attempts to contact the toy company were unsuccessful and I gave up.  I spent way to much for some plastic teeth and glasses!!
B00001OGXK,1.0,The wig was awful looking and no matter what we tried we could not get it to look anything like Austin Powers.  The fake teeth had indentations too small for adult teeth - the size looked more like an adolescent's tooth size.
B00001OGXK,5.0,Wig was great! Other Accessories were as expected. Would have worked well if the rest of the costume had fit.
B00001OGXK,4.0,Wig and necklace were great.  Teeth are gross but necessary.  You can't be Austin Powers without these.
B00001OGXK,4.0,Over all very good and needed for the costume. The only bad thing is the teeth do not stay in and have a nasty teeth so I did not use them.
B00001OGXK,1.0,Wig sucks.  The teeth don't even fit into your mouth, and they make the entire costume!  So disappointed I bought this product.  Now I am in the hole, and have no Halloween costume:/
B00001OGXK,4.0,The plastic glasses, and tin medallion are adequate as is the wig for a &quot;basic&quot; Austin Powers costume.  The teeth are useless other than a photo shoot in costume since you can not drink, eat or even speak with them losely hanging in your mouth.  However, overall, these Austin Powers accessories do the job for the reasonable price, even though they definitely do NOT provide the MOJO, baby!  (TIP: Buy the &quot;Billy Bob&quot; brand Austin Powers teeth if you want to actually wear them all night with the costume.)
B00001OGXK,5.0,It gives you a really good Austin Powers look. It is truth, the teeth are cheap but it is a costume not permanent dentures.
B00001QHXX,5.0,This mask is great! As many other reviewers have mentioned, the eye holes are a little too deep (or maybe my head is too big? Diameter 7-1/4) so I took a razor to them and cut between 1/8" and 1/4' from the eye circles all around and it still looks great and I have no discomfort in that area any more.
B00001QHXX,5.0,I bought this for Halloween obviously and everyone got a kick out of it. It is a little hard to breath in and it gets moist inside the mask after a while. Other than that it fits great and is good material.
B00001QHXX,5.0,My 7 year old son used this mask for a presentation about Richard Nixon on President's day. It worked beautifully , and he received a top mark for his speech. No problems with fit or form and the quality is very good.A.L. Stuart
B00001QHXX,5.0,When I wore this to a recent party.  Most people there thought I WAS Nixon!  Can you believe it, golly!!!?
B00001QHXX,5.0,Bought this for Halloween. Wore it to work (I teach high school science). Most of the kids had now clue who I was supposed to be, so glad I teach science.
B00001QHXX,4.0,gets reallly sweaty wearing it, but I had a blast, rode @ Hunter mtn all day w/o anyone knowing who I was, totally incogneto.
B00001QHXX,5.0,Perfect mask. Great fun. Super fast shipping. Highly recommend. Very realistic caricature. Mask is very high quality and looks and fits well.
B00001QHXX,4.0,The mask is of decent quality, but it pressed in too hard around my eyes, so I had to cut them back a little. Also, it muffles speech sufficiently enough that I opened the mouth up as well. Overall though, it certainly serves its purpose and is great for costumes or whatever you would use it for.
B00001QHXX,5.0,I love the mask, very good quality, and very funny. Only problem was the eye holes. They are far to small. Nothing a pair of small scissors couldn't fix, though.
B00001QHXX,5.0,I... uh... am not sure if... this review is under oath... so I uh, can't really attest to its quality... but I will say that it's a damn handsome face.It's so handsome I would pay someone to storm Amazon's warehouse to get one... without my knowledge, of course...
B00001QHXX,5.0,My son did a report on President Nixon for 4th grade project.  It made his report stand out!  I have since used it twice for my 1st grade class President Report projects ... the kids love it!  Great product.
B00001QHXX,4.0,It clearly shows that you are trying to look like Richard Nixon, and the exaggerated features are nothing other than fantastic. From the bulbous nose, to the large saggy cheeks are a delight to look at, causing laughter where ever I go. Also the mask is easily put on and taken off unlike other masks I have, which make me very hot and sweaty in them. The reason being it does not cover all of your head and neck like other masks do. It reveals your neck and both ears allowing for easy removal.
B00001QHXX,5.0,One of the best masks we had found. I couldn't believe it was so great. It wasn't  all squashed up and cheap. My son has had so much fun with it!
B00001QHXX,5.0,It was a gift for my brother-in-law.  He has a big head.  The mask fit perfectly, including the eye holes.  The price was excellent!
B00001QHXX,4.0,This is awesome fun. You may need to adjust the eye holes slightly as they tend to irritate your eyes. Otherwise, sturdy vinyl, not plastic, makes this a good buy.
B00001QHXX,3.0,i can see out of the eye holes to close to my face which cause my eye lashes to hit the mask
B00001QHXX,4.0,The mask is high quality, just as good (if not better) than anything I would've gotten in a local Halloween store.It isn't  very good for wearing a long time - and the eye holes suck to your face and can be extremely uncomfortable. Once you cut out the eye-holes a little to customize it to your face, and tuck the chin under a little it's fine.
B00001QHXX,4.0,Oh, give me a break.I'm a politician. When I'm not kissing babies,I'm stealing their lollipops. You should have known something waswrong when Spiro, my first vice-president, was forced to resign,You'll feel better about me on Halloween, I'm sure.
B00001QHXX,5.0,My 14 yr old son wanted this mask for Halloween.  What a great replica of Richard Nixon!  Of course, it pokes fun at the size of his nose.  It was hillarious watching my son walk around, hands out in a peace sign, saying "I am not a crook" over and over!!  :)
B00001QHXX,5.0,My parents had this mask years ago.  I saw it on Amazon and had to have it.  Gave it to my brother for Christmas because he used to run around the house doing a Nixon impersonation.  His 6 year-old son grabbed the mask from his dad Christmas day and had us all laughing hysterically as he walked around the room shaking his head and giving the &#34;Nixon&#34; peace sign.
B00001QHXX,5.0,My son and his friends decided to be the Ex Presidents from the movie &#34;Point Break&#34; for Halloween.  He had originally wanted a $100 mask from another site and there was no WAY I was spending that much.  I knew Amazon would come through for me and they did--in a big way.  This mask was only $16, I got it in 2 days and it is PERFECT.  I can't believe the quality for the price.  The eye holes are a little small as some people mentioned and there is no opening at the mouth but my son doesn't mind and you could always cut it a little bit if you needed too.  Great purchase, very happy!
B00001QHXX,5.0,I have a 24" head and this mask fits perfectly. Be prepared to do a little trim work around the eyes and mouth. Nothing a small pair of scissors can't handle.It's perfect for all your Point Break needs!
B00001QHXX,4.0,The mask is very reminding of nixon's face and very funny with the giant nose. The only complaint is that the way it sits on the face it puts pressure all the way around the eyes and is somewhat uncomfortable.
B00001QHXX,5.0,I bought this for my costume last Halloween (yes, I am very slow to review it).  After all, what's scarier than Nixon?
B00001QHXX,3.0,I rate it a 3 because of the fit.  Very difficult to wear due to the eye holes - actually hurts.  Suspect that's my anatomy, but a &#34;unisex&#34; item that's only limited to a small subset of folks seems rather pointless.
B00001QHXX,5.0,Be prepared for lots of comments if you buy this mask. I wore it when I took my niece to a Halloween concert by the local symphony orchestra. One man walked past me with his kids and said, &#34;You see that man - he lies&#34; to which I replied with two fingers of each hand upraised and said &#34;I am not a crook!&#34; We all laughed. It looks just like Nixon.
B00001QHXX,4.0,This Is A Qualoty Item But You Might Need To Make The Eye Holes Bigger.  Be Careful How You Do It Though.
B00001QHXX,4.0,I really enjoy this mask, but it is a little tight around the eyes.  The rubber is easily adjusted to make room.  One downside was that I had trouble convincing people I wasn't a crook (sarcasm).
B00001QHXX,5.0,This mask is awesome!! I can live out my dream of being my role model Richard M. Nixon on a daily basis now! My life is complete having this mask!! I think everyone should have a mask of their favorite role model!! And you just can't beat the price! I mean, fulfillment in life for a mere 25 bucks!!! It just doesn't get any better than that!! All of my friends love it too! We get together weekly with our mask and it's like the good old days! Reagan, Bush, Nixon, Carter, and even the other Bush have a get together where we discuss TV shows like &#34;The Life of a President&#34; and &#34;4 More Years of Nothing&#34; It's awesome, I can't praise it enough.
B00001QHXX,5.0,The mask was very realistic & was a major hit at the Halloween party I attended--Let me make that perfectly clear. Actually, I detected actual fear in the eyes of kids & adults when I wore the mask, much more fear than those goblins, witches & zombies who also attended. I had to take the mask off periodically to quiet mounting anxiety. I can't wait to buy the Hillary mask next year; anybody know where I can get an X-L brown pantsuit?
B00001QHXX,5.0,Be the talk of the town and the life of the party with this official RMN vinyl mask.  The face that launched a thousand congressional investigations.  Don't be satisfied with just being an accessory to obstruction of justice.  Go straight to the source.  It's Nixon Now!
B00001QHXX,5.0,I loved wearing my Richard Nixon mask two Halloweens ago. It definitely is a creepy mask to wear around people, especially with the giant nose! I would definitely recommend it to people.
B00001QHXX,3.0,This is a great, realistic mask. The nose especially. the only problem is the eyeholes. I couldn't open my eyes all the way, or for very long.
B00001QHXY,5.0,I wore this mask on a family vacation to Washington DC.  It was so realistic that white house interns were tripping over each other to get some action from me.  I give the product 5 stars for helping me have the best visit to the nations capital ever.  My wife hates it, though.
B00001QHXY,5.0,I used this for a halloween party and practiced for about an hour beforehand getting my Bill accent down.  People thought it was hysterical.  This make really does look creepily similar to the real thing, and even better it works as a natural libido booster!
B00001QHXY,3.0,My husband wore this to a Halloween Party.  We had to modify the eye openings to re-shape to his face.  After customizing the eyes, it worked great.
B00001QHXY,3.0,It was okay but way too hot to wear all night and the plastic underlining was a tad uncomfortable. Overall an okay mask, but I would not buy it again
B00001QHXY,2.0,MASK GOT THE JOB DONE FOR MY COSTUME BUT PAINFUL TO WEAR.  HAD TO CUT EYES OUT A BIT.  IN ADDITION IT WAS EXTREMELY HOT AND LOOKED LIKE A MIX BETWEEN JAY LENO AND BILL CLINTON
B00001QHXY,4.0,This is a great mask. It fits me well and it is very comfortable. This mask really does look a whole lot like Bill Clinton himself. I would give this product a five star rating, but I can't since I'm not real big fan of Bill Clinton. I like the mask more than I like Bill Clinton. I would highly recommend this product!
B00001QHXY,4.0,The mask is really quite nice.  Big enough to fit anyone and not be like putting on a wet suit.  Had a very strong chemical smell when new, so I put it away to let that dissipate.
B00001QHXY,4.0,This mask runs a little bit but who would want a rubber mask molded right against their face. A piece of tape on the back to hold it closed tighter would work perfectly well. This is a pretty decent mask and I am still able to see out the relatively small eye holes clearly.
B00001QHXY,4.0,This gave a good laugh.  Not as breathable as I hoped and that's the only reason it didn't get 5 stars.
B00001QHXY,1.0,The eye sockets go back to far and rub your eyelids while wearing the mask maybe I have a large head, but still can't wear it comfortably
B00001QHXY,5.0,This mask was the only one that I could find that wasn't too much like a cartoon. It worked great! I feel we got what we paid for.
B00001QHXY,5.0,I bought this mask to compliment my Obama Mask and it is perfect! the detailing on the face resembles Clinton exactly as well as an excellent paint job.
B00001QHXY,5.0,Very nice mask! I bought it for a friend. She is going to use it to create a Halloween dummy.
B00001QHXY,5.0,This mask is simply too funny.  I love it and use it for Halloween.  I also have Nixon and Reagan.  LOL
B00001QHXY,3.0,Bill Clinton Mask Standard size it was small, tight in the eyes and in the mouth area.They didn't offer a larger size.
B00001T38R,4.0,I really liked this helmet, it looks realistic and it is a full helmet (not a mask) so that is awesome, it looks great in pictures! But it is very uncomfortable to wear for a long time, it is very difficult to see while wearing it (and I can't wear it with my glasses).So if you're planning to wear it for a halloween costume I am not sure if that is a good idea since I can't wear it for longer than 15min without having to take it off and breath. But it looks great as decoration and in pictures. It is definitely realistic.
B00001T38R,4.0,So sure, the helmet is not the most practical for actual wear. Though I think you could easily fix that issue with a few thin strips of foam material from a craft shop. I think this helmet is a blast though! I mostly just leave it sitting around my apartment, it's practically a conversation piece! Now & again it makes for some fun & interesting photos too! I'm not sure why so many reviews for this product around the net were a bit harsh, because I think it rocks for the price! It's pretty durable & made well too, minus a slightly cheap feeling antenna. So I could see it being a bit uncomfy for actual wear, but I think it's a great helmet!
B00001T38R,2.0,I ordered this helmet thinking it would be better than the 2 piece mask that came with the Deluxe Boba Fett costume.  I read the reviews, which were mostly positive....in my opinion the mask is below expectation.  Do not buy this if you are expecting anything better.The visor is half vinyl, half plastic visor.  Not sure why. You can see this in the stock photo, and I should have noticed it before purchasing because its not what I would expect.The overall shape of the helmet is just not quite right. It seems to be constructed too narrow overall.  The bottom of the "visor" is tapered outward from the top, and is then too wide at the bottom. The profile of the mask also extends outwards.  The paint job is not that great.  The red is very dull.  Its also lacks the contrast of the greens on the mask.The only pro's is that its a helmet, not a mask, and it has the dent in the top..and an antenna that leans to one side..Thats all the positives I can find.I do not try to find the negatives, but I find the mask is below expectations.  I do not recommend spending $40 for this when the mask that comes with the costume has better paint, and overall looks better.
B00001T38R,4.0,I purchase this for an upcoming Halloween, since our families theme will be star Wars.  I needed something cheap, but not toyish looking.  The helmet is very sturdy, but pliable.  Yet, it wasn't wide enough looking compared to the original Boba Fett.  So I did have to bend it, to widen it out, which lead to a little pressing of my nose against the vinyl.  Still, it's not uncomfortably so.  Yet I'm female (noses are usually smaller), so if you were looking to do the same... you might luck out.
B00001T38R,5.0,I bought this helmet for a Halloween costume and thought it was better than the helmet that came with my costume. I was right. This helmet is pretty solid and awesome. I played a show in this helmet with my band which was difficult but I was able to do it. I Recommend this helmet to any one looking for a good Boba Fett helmet with out wanting to drop a bunch of money.
B00001T38R,2.0,I purchased this - as an adult female, the fit is pretty close, my nose is squished and i can not wear my glasses.  In addition the interior is not well finished (dripping looking plastic) and contains no padding. the helmet is uncomfortable and does not sit right on my head.
B00001T38R,4.0,Awesome mask for the price. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but this exceeded my expectations. It's a fun mask that looks pretty cool for my comicon costume. Worth the money. I'd recommend getting a little bit of padding for the top and sides for a better fit.
B00001T38R,4.0,Looks good, but as other reviews stated, its tight across the bridge of the nose and hard to see out of.
B00001T38Y,4.0,It is indeed a full size adult helmet. The plastic is made of stronger material than most masks. It is perfect size. I would highly recommend glue or tape to hold it together, as the snaps don't work too well.
B00001T38Y,5.0,I purchased this mask to upgrade my halloween costume. It is a much better design then the one that came with the costume. After I used it I gave it to my brother who is a big fan of Stormtroopers and he loved it. Great quality at a good price. Recommend to everyone.
B00001T38Y,5.0,This is a very good mask and my kid loves it. The only problem is that it comes in two pieces,it fell apart a lot at first but some super glue made it whole and fixed it right up.
B00001T38Y,4.0,Worth the price to make it a costume rather than just having a mask.I took other reviewers' advice and used super glue while assembling.I don't know if it was a matter of size, but it was a bit wobbly on my head (adult female), so I duct taped in a piece of elastic to go under my chin to keep it more secure.
B00001T38Y,2.0,From the picture it looks like a good helmet, but it comes in two pieces and you have to snap them together which can be hard to do and comes apart. If you do get this, buy some glue too, to hold it together. My three year old son wanted a Stormtrooper Helmet  for Christmas sooo bad, so i thought this would do. yeah he did not know the difference but i feel bad for not spending a little more and getting him a nice one.
B00001T38Y,4.0,Although it doesn't have the structural stability of the scale replica, this mask does a great job. A little hot glue gunning to the the main seam and it's ready to go. Also mouthhole is a little bit of breathing difficulty but not too bad. Overall it will do the trick
B00001T38Y,4.0,The structure of the helmet is really nice it comes in 4 pieces 2 halfs then the ears  which help hold them together, the optics on the helmet are really hard to see because of the curvature of the plastics but other then that it works if u look straight out. As for the inside of the helmet there is only a few foam pieces for ur head which doesnt offer back and front support so u may need to add more also super glue the structure together to insure full stability. and finally everything but the front nose pieces are just stickers some were a little lose when it came in but I'm planning on just taking them off and painting on a better quality design, that way it gives me something to do and also improves the looks of the helmet. Other than that totally worth the $30 bucks i spent on it!
B00001T38Y,5.0,you pay for what you get.  The picture that is shown does not look like what I received. Little things like the eyes are actually clear and don't have holes in them. it comes with a back which is a plus.  the paint isn't very well done but it looks better than the picture.
B00001T38Y,4.0,I think this is a perfect helmet for a halloween costume. realistic enough but also wearable and you can see out of the eyeholes.  We duct taped it together on the inside and it is very functional.
B00001T38Y,4.0,well for the money it is a very good copy of the star wars stormtrooper helmet, it's light easy to ware and you can see out of the eyes well, it dose need some Assembly as it comes in four parts front, back and two earpieces. as a play thing it's great, for the collector not so much. I had to use some duct tape on the inside to keep it from coming apart but all and all it was a good buy I hope to find the deluxe stormtrooper custom so I can use it together
B00001T38Y,5.0,thanks for the mask is awesome and perfect fit hope see you soon for next purchases...take care pal see ya...bye
B00001T38Y,2.0,$45 for a product that probably cost $2.50 to make.  The stickers on it are peeling off.  Really bad odor inside.  The clips that push in together to hold it together were very bent and required me to pry them back into shape before the helmet snaps in place.  The black visors in the picture are misleading.  The visor color on mine was a yellowish see through material.  Very hard to see out of.  I'll definitely need to get the glue out to hold the helmet together and restick the peeling stickers.  When it arrived it looked like it had been open before.  There was tape holding parts of the plastic together.  Is it worth $45? No way.  Will it work?  Yes.  But don't get your hopes up about this.  Overall it's pretty junky.
B00001T38Y,4.0,I was just pretty good, I was hoping for the very hard plastic like the talking darth vader helmet is but its not. Its way better than the one that came with a costume so Im pretty happy.
B00001T38Y,5.0,Good mask, built out of heavier plastic than the ones that come with most costumes. Would recommend gluing or taping the parts together, they snap together but better safe than sorry.
B00001T38Y,3.0,Consider two things: 1, you get what you pay for, and 2, everything labelled 'Star Wars' is overpriced. The helmet that shipped looked a little better than the one in the picture (transparent lenses instead of eye holes, for instance), but most of the details are just stickers (which started peeling off before delivery), the colors are wrong (mine had a blue frown), and the padding inside the helmet had already fallen out when I opened the package. After re-painting the outside and re-padding the inside, it worked decently well. It would have been nice if I didn't have to put hours of work into something I already paid too much for, though.
B00001T38Y,5.0,just gotta glue or tape the parts and its perfect to wear out to a costume party. not bad for the price.
B00001T38Y,4.0,Let's start off with the fact that I'm a full grown adult. For some reason I decided I needed a Stormtrooper helmet to wear with my Utilikilt. I know... an odd combination to some, but makes perfect sense to me. I started looking for helmets here on Amazon and found the one I wanted. Only problem was it costs $150. I actually put it in my wish list to ponder whether I'd be willing to part with $150 for something that I wasn't going to wear that often. Finally decided to go with the economy version and bought this one.First, as others have pointed out, the helmet that ships isn't the one in the photo. The black perforated eye areas actually have smoked gray plastic lenses (thankfully). Most everything else seems to be pretty accurate. Also, as others have pointed out, the helmet is in 4 pieces that don't stay together very well. You'll want some krazy glue or duct tape to make sure you're not fighting with it if you drop it or are a little rough on it. Even when it's put together I can see a bit of a gap on the seam that runs across the top. Not a huge deal as most people won't be able to see it, but it's there.I'd still like to have one of the better helmets, but until somebody smacks me on the bum with a golden spoon I'll settle for the $22 version. BTW, I also ordered a Stormtrooper white t-shirt (that looks like the torso of the stormtrooper armor) to wear with it. Found it here on Amazon as well for about $20.
B00001T38Y,2.0,For the price of this product, I expected a higher quality mask.  This is more like a cheap Halloween costume piece.
B00001T38Y,4.0,I got this for Halloween and worked great with my outfit. I added extra foam to the inside to give extra padding. The Mask fell apart late in the night so i would recommend gluing it together it together.
B00001T38Y,4.0,ITs more for decoration then anythign for us. You can wear it and comfortably for halloween or whatever but we use it as a decoration mostly . Its very lightweight and is not durable enough to give to a younger child - it would break.
B00001T38Y,5.0,BEST MASK FOR THE MONEY!Background: I am what most people call a "NERD" and what most nerds call "Boss".Review:Firstly, the shipping on standard came in less than 3 days!Secondly, the quality is amazing! It is rugged, not floppy, and assembled in about 5 minutes of fidgeting.Thirdly, I went to a half dozen costume shops and saw the $99 helmets and they were only VERY slightly better quality than this unit.BUY THIS BEAUTIFUL HELMET!Thank you,Matthew
B00001T38Y,3.0,This helmet is not as well finished as the picture.  Very dull paint with lots of defects.  Several of the assembly tabs were broken off inside the package, but I was able to repair it.  Unless this helmet is going to sit on a shelf, YOU MUST GLUE IT TOGETHER !  I bought this for my 8yro to play with inside and outside, so the low quality finish isn't too big a deal.  Good price for a helmet that will get beat up anyway.  Will buy another one if this one gets destroyed while being played with.
B00001T38Y,2.0,Flimsy and kinda low quality. Most of the decals are actually stickers that are hastily applied, some of which were peeling off when I took it out of the package. The parts that ARE painted began chipping off almost immediately. I might have a weird shaped head, but the helmet wobbles a lot while wearing it, and it's incredibly difficult to see out of the eyeholes. The front and back of the helmet are held together with flimsy plastic clips, so the pieces of the helmet don't fit together all that well.On the whole, it served it's purpose as a cheap, last minute Halloween costume... But if you're looking for a collector's item or display piece, spring for a more expensive helmet.
B00001T38Y,2.0,This mask is a cheap plastic piece of crap. There are eye holes to see out of but they are crappy, cloudy, distorting garbage so wearing this makes it almost impossible to see even straight ahead. Also, unless you super glue the whole thing together after assembly, it'll all fall apart pretty quickly.This is only good for posing for pictures or to have as a conversation piece decoration.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS AS PART OF AN ACTUAL COSTUME.
B00001T38Y,4.0,After reading other reviews, I was skeptical about the helmet, but I needed to do something quick.  I had to rendezvous with other Storm Troopers at the Cantina for Halloween!  The helmet was the best part of my costume and got rave reviews.  Yep, it's just thin cheap plastic with decals.  You have to snap the front to the back,  snap on two side pieces, then add some tape so it doesn't fall apart.  Yep, it's overpriced for what it is, but if you want to be a Storm Trooper, it's pretty easy to make the armor out of cardboard and duct tape in a couple of hours. Buying this helmet will save you a lot of hassle as that's the hardest part to create.
B00001T38Y,4.0,For the price, you cant beat it.  I think I paid thirty bucks for mine and it was pretty nice after some slight modifications on my part.  I bought it for part of a halloween costume. Worked great and recieved lots of compliments on it.  Lots of fun for around $30.
B00001T38Y,5.0,Awesome mask! It is great and works great as well!  I got a lot of complements on it and people love it!
B00001T38Y,3.0,I bought this as a joke knowing that it would not be a very good fit nor of great quality, but that's not why I wanted the helmet.  I've worn it while driving (only out of a parking lot and never in traffic) to draw laughs from co-workers and others, which it does every time.  It's almost impossible to see out of the darn thing so be careful wearing it and do what I did - remove the eye covers and just wear your sunglasses underneath for the same effect, otherwise you'll have problems.  I did wear it once through a drive-up fast food window and the kids inside liked it so much they offered me a free order of fries, which I refused saying (in my best Darth Vader accent), &#34;My master doesn't allow his stormtroopers to eat fried food.&#34;  BTY:  You'll need to use some serious glue to hold the helmet halves together!  Have fun!
B00001T38Y,3.0,It's ok.  Helmet doesn't stay together very well and side ear piecesdon't stay on.  Had to tape it together with clear packing tape. But mykid still likes it.
B00001T38Y,3.0,If you are a serious collector then this is definitely not the mask for you. it feels very cheap in the hand, and the side pieces to clip it all together pops out ridiculously easy.if you are looking for something to wear at a party then this is for you. but again it needs to heavy modification. I ended up having to stick a tonne load of padding on the inside before it could fit my head comfortably. (and mind you, i have a fairly big head)if you don't mind having to tinker with it after you buy it then I guess you can get this ... if not ... prepare to dish out a few extra bucks to modify it
B00001T8RT,3.0,DELUXE HALLOWEEN SKULL WARRIOR TRIDENT COSTUME ACCESSORY...It has satisfied my 10 year old in his quest for a trident, but he was disappointed that it was not the 55" as advertised.  It is exactly 48" from tip of trident to bottom of staff.  He was expecting it to be taller than him but is still loving to play with it.  Overall the toy is fun and cool looking.
B00001TAOY,5.0,I used these when making a Ninja puppet for my college age daughter, so they were not roughly used.  They are a firm plastic, so would last a child a while but not indestructible.
B00001TOXD,3.0,The broom was not what was expected. It was VERY small, (good for a costume for a 5-7 year old) and it was not full at all! The handle was pretty unrealistic looking because it was smooth bamboo, and the bottom was so thin that you could see the bamboo stick through the weeds. So not the best, but it came in a timely matter, undamaged, and hey what can you expect for $9?
B00001TOXD,1.0,The broom that we received was definitely not as pictured. There were only a few twigs tied on instead of the thick broom shown. I'm definitely not crafty which is why we purchased this in the first place so I can't even fix it, nor do we have time now to get it replaced! I recommend shopping around at other local or online stores before buying this one.
B00001TOXD,1.0,I wouldn't even give this product 1 star.  Received it today.  Attempted to take it out of the shipping bag it was placed in only to have the item literally fall apart.  The "straw" and rope were half way up the stick when I tried to take it out.  The rope was half unwrapped.  The "straw" immediately started falling on the floor.  The stick had a huge notch out of it.  HIGHLY disappointed.  Such a waste of money.  The quality of this item is not even worthy of 1 star.  This will be heading back immediately in the same bag it came in otherwise I'm afraid it would fall apart trying to put it in something else.
B00001TOXD,1.0,This broom was much, much more sparce in the bristle department than the picture would lead one to believe. All the bristles fell off when the bit of twine holding them on came unglued. My kid wasn't trying to sweep or use it as a broom, just "fly" it about the house. Not worth it for a toy that fell apart after three days.
B00001TOXD,1.0,This was extremely misleading! I am 5ft 7in. tall. This may be tall enough for a munchkin, or a child never for an adult?!! Also it is very cheaply made. I will keep this for a wall decoration for Halloween, if it doesn't fall apart before then! But I will be careful of buying something like this again.
B00001TOXD,3.0,Looked good however the bristles fell out of broom so easilyI would recommend as a decoration but not to use as part of a costume
B00001TOXD,1.0,THis was bought for a wedding. It was decorated and set out so the couple could jump the broomIt was not used as a toy
B00001TOXD,2.0,Broom fell apart before Hallowen had to put back together.Fell apart again didn't last long would not recommend.Bad construction.
B00001TOXD,2.0,Poor quality. Straight out of the bag I had to start repairs on it. I wish I had read the other reviews BEFORE purchase.
B00001TOXD,1.0,I bought this broom for my girlfriend's costume for a comic book convention she and I attended. She said that out of the box, it began to fall apart. She had to hot glue it back together in time for the event.
B00001TOXD,5.0,I bought this for my girlfriend. She was a little taken back at first, but now loves riding it around the apartment. I hope one day soon she'll have enough courage to go for a ride about  the neighborhood.
B00001TOXD,2.0,Very small in reference to the picture-- maybe good for a small child to use as a prop but definitely disappointed in size for an adult to use-- the bottom part is not full enough--- Im trying to figure out a way to bulk it up!
B00001TOXD,5.0,I would agree with others that this may be a fragile item. I bought it for ornamental use though and it was fantastic. Very cute! Very seasonal! I really enjoyed this item.
B00001TOXD,2.0,I wish the the description had included the demensions.  I was hoping toes this as a prop in our high school play however it is much too small to be used by a high school student.  It would be the correct size for a child.  It is also quite cheaply made.  Over all if was very disappointed.  The picture was misleading.
B00001TOXD,1.0,Fell apart several times before the first use. The straw is held on to the stick with only twine and the twine is not sufficiently tight or properly strung to stay attached to the handle.
B00001TOXD,1.0,this is the worst product I ever ordered from Amazon an I am letting you all know do not order it,,it came to me broken it dont even look like a broom,,it looks like something a 2yr, old would try to make,the handle was broke,,there was hardly any broom part on it,,an its not the size they said it would be,an it dont look anything like the picture.Rubie's Adult Witch BroomI would seriously think twice before ordering from this company,an its only an adult broom if your 30 inchs tall!!!!!!!
B00001TOXD,1.0,It is about 3 feet tall, so if you are very short, it might work, but I was a broomless witch last Halloween because it stayed in the closet.
B00001TOXD,3.0,The broom stick was super small.  The bristle part of the broom was very thin and chinsey looking.  I expected a larger broom with a full bottom.
B00001TOXD,4.0,The sticks fall off easily, and are not as thick as the picture, but it's a costume broom.  They don't need to actually sweep a floor, and I have trees in my backyard that can give an endless supply of more sticks.  It would be really easy to shove more sticks under the rope holding them onto the handle if I needed to.  With prime, it's $10.  I would've spent that much at the craft store on materials to build my own, so worked out great.
B00001TOXD,3.0,it is great for the price if it is only for looks and or a costume. it is not an adult size broom! it fits my 5 year old daughter perfectly and that is why i got it. i thought i was going to have to cut off about 2 feet ,just cus it sed adult size, but that was not the case. it is tinny and great for small kids . cheeply made ,so if you want to sweep your defiantly looking at the wrong one.lol
B00001TOXD,4.0,This was a cool accessory to my witch costume. My only complaint is that it should be a few inches longer.
B00001TOXD,5.0,Since my neice,nephew and I have decided to go as wizard of oz characters this year - i found this to be perfect for my costume - the wicked witch.
B00001TOXD,1.0,This broom definitely wasn't worth it.  There is barely anything to it.  It is small with very few bristles. I bought it as a prop for a witch costume.  It definitely wont work for that.  It barely works as a Halloween decorative piece.
B00001TOXD,5.0,This accessory makes you feel like a real witch! it is perfect! I like the color and the shape! we got it on time
B00001TOXD,5.0,fast and great shape thank you all for making my husbands last days with us pleasent we had early holidays before he passed away thank you all
B00001TOXD,1.0,Was terrible. Fell apart the moment it was opened. Unusable completely! Got my money back- but bummed at the product
B00001TOXD,1.0,I did not listen to all the other reviews and went and bought this anyways because my son wanted a &#34;real witches broom&#34; for Christmas, well we never even got it out of the package and it fell apart.  It now is just put away on a shelf becuase I do not know what to do with the thing, you move it or touch it and twigs just fall off.  Very messy.
B00001TOXD,4.0,i like it light weight very nice for wizaed of oz costume as a witch or another prop good buy
B00001TOXD,2.0,I was not impressed with my purchase.  The broom looked nothing like the picture.  Specifically, it hardly has any bristles.  I would not recommend purchasing this.
B00001TOXD,1.0,I wasn't happy about this at all. I bought it for a stage prop and it fell apart before we got it there. It is not full like the picture either. Misleading. :(
B00001TOXD,2.0,Didn't receive the broom.  Had to call and get a new one delivered.  Then it fell apart.  Was not happy at all.
B00001TOXD,1.0,Total waste of money! I spent almost as much for this tiny little broom, as I did for the costume!! Boo! Major disappointment!
B00001TOXD,3.0,My 4 year old daughter wanted to be a witch for Halloween so I got her this broomstick. She also wanted to fly all over our small apartment.The handle was too long for her to control and the broom was made of thick twigs that came off one by one. It lasted a short time.
B00001TOXD,1.0,I got this broom for a film project. So excited when it came in the huge box! I opened it and found a 20&#34; broom at the very bottom. &#34;Adult&#34; witch broom is more so a &#34;toddler&#34; witch broom. I ha to replace the bamboo stick with a big bamboo stick, which then made the bristles at the end not proportionate.
B00001TOXD,1.0,I bought this as a prop for a play and the seller's description said that it was 48" long.  It was almost 10" shorter, and therefore unuseable in the way for which I had purchased it.
B00001TOXD,3.0,Looks larger in the picture.  This is a broom for a small child &  the bottom is sparse.  I was not going to spend the money to sendit back so I hung on the mailbox (came with a plastic loop).  It's really tough to find a decent adult size  witch's broom.  I have evenlooked on the wiccan websites & their brooms are very expensive (especially when figuring in the s & h charges).  I have no youngchildren in the family because I would have given the broom to that child.
B00001TPZJ,4.0,The C3PO costume is simple and honestly it's overpriced for the polyester suit.  But then we want fun things for our kids right?  I would have given 3 stars due to the quality, but I gave it a 4 since my son loves this costume.  He wears it constantly.  He's an average sized 6 year old boy (height and weight).  I bought a medium costume thinking that he'll probably want to use it next year as well.  Chances are slim as the costume fits perfectly now... maybe a bit long on the legs.  He wears a shirt & shorts underneath - I assume that's how the costume should be worn.
B00001TPZJ,5.0,Inexpensive and fun.  Half mask is just fine.  Got a large and it is a bit big on our 7 yr. old but works just fine.  Great purchase.
B00001TPZJ,4.0,My son wanted to be C3PO for Halloween. This costume was perfect. Ordering was easy and shipping could not have been more prompt.
B00001TPZJ,4.0,This costume wasn't available in our local Target, so was unique and the only C3PO we saw this Halloween season. It fit our 8 year old son well, and held up for a few wearings and is still in good shape.
B00001TPZJ,2.0,Kind of cheaply made but the kids like it so that's all that matters really.  Wish there was a R2D2 costume to go with it that was for older kids not just infants.
B00001TPZJ,5.0,I got this for my 5-year old son. The Medium size was perfect for him. It had some extra, needed room to wear warm clothes underneath (we live in Wisconsin!) for trick or treating. He loved it!
B00001TPZJ,4.0,Received the costume. Packed great. Looks good. Just had to make a couple of adjustments to the length of the legs and mask elastic band to better fit child.
B00001TQ1S,5.0,I received the hat ,It has great quality and well made .It fit perfectly and was very comfortable .would recommend the hat to any one
B00001TQ1S,5.0,This headpiece is exactly what I expected. A quality product. The only downfall was that the material was in a package which put creases into the foam type material that was impossible for me to iron or straighten out.  If the piece was shipped with cardboard in it to hold the shape of the hat it would be a much better look. I ended up taking the hair out of the headpiece and using it with the hat that came with my costume.
B00001TQ1U,1.0,The bottle LOOKS pretty..but it was very flimsy.  It was for a Halloween costume..so it served its purpose..but I wouldn't waste my money on it again if I had the choice.
B00001TQ1U,3.0,Yes, it's just a cheap blow-up bottle but it served it's purpose for our costume.  My son was Ninjini from Skylanders and this was great because it was lightweight and I attached a magnet to it and his shirt so he could have it on his back (Ninjini throws some sort of power-attack from her bottle).  Don't have high expectations but it worked for us!
B00001TQ1U,1.0,I was very disappointed in this item.  I thought it was a "bottle" and it is "just a balloon."  If you can find a REAL Genie Bottle, I sure would be interested in looking at it.
B00001TQ1U,1.0,This item is advertised as a replica of the I dream of Jeannie bottle from the series of the same name.  It's an inflatible item as stated by the vendor.  The problem is it's very difficult to inflate and even when you do (and it takes a long time) it is not a "replica" of the I dream of Jeannie Bottle.  It's described in a mis-leading matter and after this I found a real replica and it's night and day.  This one I deflated but that sure didn't take long.I feel it's also a high price between the tag price and shipping for what it is.  It looks like something you'd float in a pool.
B00001TQ1U,5.0,I purchased this as an accessory for my 10 yr niece, Rayna, who was "Jeannie" for Halloween. The bottle was adorable and so was Jeannie. Great buy/Happy Jeannie
B00001TQ1U,3.0,It's cheap and cheerful. I added stick on jewels and some braid and tassels. Now it looks much prettier! It is for use with a costume in a kiddie parade. It has held air for over a month but has not been played with at all.
B00001TQ1X,3.0,This toy is definately cheaply made, good for a costume which is what I bought it for but I wouldn't suggest it for an everyday play toy. Our basket ended up coming apart after a night of trick or treating. As for Toto he isn't very cute or well made to be a loving stuffed animal, I was reading the other reviews mentioning his 'teeth' I don't remember seeing any teeth maybe they fell off? I don't know, lol. It did it's job on Halloween night but unfortunately the basket was trashed and Toto befriended our dog and hasn't been seen since.
B00001TQ1X,2.0,I put cat on the title because the so call dog looks more like a cat or rat buy my daughter hated it I didn't send it back because it would cast more then the item would never buy or tell somebody to buy it
B00001TQ1X,3.0,I purchased this for a child as an accessory to a Wizard of Oz dress-up trunk. Although it's more a costume accessory than a toy, it's pretty sturdy. The "basket" is made of plastic and is a nice size for little girls (I purchased it for a four-year-old). The only problem is the weird expression on Toto's face. His mouth is wide open, revealing goofy jagged teeth (think: felt cut by pinking sheers) and a big pink tongue just stuck there in the middle. It would have been better to include a little dog with a closed mouth. This expression makes Toto look sort of demented. Even my niece asked why his mouth was open in that weird way and she didn't play with it nearly as much as she did the rest of the Oz accessories.
B00001TQ1X,4.0,Yes, the Toto looks goofy as heck. I took it out of the box and my co-workers and I spent 10 minutes laughing about how they thought the Toto was a rat. But I fluffed up its fur a bit and it looked fine. For the price, it was satisfactory. The ones I saw in Halloween stores were $20 so for less than half of that, I'll take a goofy-looking Toto.
B00001TQ1X,4.0,This is perfect for Dorthy costume and the price cannot be beat.  The only thing is the weird teeth on the dog...kinda scary looking like the dog has rabies.  However, the teeth are made of felt material.  So, I was able just to cut them off and you could not even tell and the dog looked cute again :-)  I would recommend!
B00001TQ1X,1.0,This was a waste of money. When I received it and took toto out of the basket he was Scary looking! My daughter would have been petrified of him. They made him showing sharp teeth. He didn't look anything like toto at all.
B00001TQ1X,4.0,Its small and cute and works for what we bought it for. The price was a little high but what else are ya goin to do when your lookin for specific stuff?
B00001TQ1X,2.0,This is really cheap  looking. The dog looks like a furry rat. Not at all what I thought it was going to be.  I'm sure it will last about one day after being played with.
B00001TQ1X,1.0,Smalles than expected. Toto looks more like a rat than a dog. We will not be using this for her costume
B00001TQ1X,1.0,this doesn't even resemble a dog - it looks like a hairy rat - very poor quality and small, small, small
B00001TQ1X,1.0,Flimsy basket came apart and the handle came off the first day of play.  My daughter asked why Toto looks scary.  The stuffed toy dogs muzzle expression looks sort of frightening.  Total waste of money.
B00001TQ2V,5.0,Costume is exactly as described.  Wig runs a little small, but my daughter doesn't wear it anyway.
B00001TQ2V,5.0,Rubies has an excellent selection and our daughter made a great Princess Leia is this costume. Halloween is so much fun around here, and this costume and accessories just made it even better.
B00001TQ34,5.0,Ok, so I got this in plenty of time for halloween this year. I'm a soldier in Iraq, and when the people in my company got a sight of me in skin tight spandex.. well.. hilarity ensued.. I would definately recommend a jock strap and cup, because I had to place my junk in a sock so that there would  be no genital definition.. wife made me :) I'm about 6'2, and the costume was way too short for me.. but it'd be good for the average guy of 5'9, or 5'10.. but for the laughs I got, it was totally worth the $30.. seeing as I won $50 in our costume contest.. there was a little danving involved, had to shake my stuff.. and until you see a tall, skinny white guy shakin his groove thing in a skin tight spiderman costume.. well.. you just haven't lived..
B00001TQ34,5.0,I got the spiderman costume so my son come to my grandson,s 7th birthday party at the skating rink,and it was a great day all the kids loved it even kids that was not at our party was trying to see spiderman.
B00001TQ34,2.0,I bought this costume some years ago to wear to work for halloween. I'm about 6 foot, and it was like I was waiting for the flood (I.e. very short). In fairness, and also to cover up areas that can't be shown at work, I wore work pants underneath. However, I tried it on without before that, and it was still bad. I bet if you're around 5'8&#34; or so, it would fit great. The mask is HORRIBLE! It is a foam mask, and it's bulky and not form fitting at all.Go with it if you have no other options. It'll work in a pinch. But get a good mask, not the one they provide with the costume.
B00001TQ34,2.0,The neck was torn and too late to get it exchanged.  Over all I guess the costume would have been ok, but disappointed with the defect.
B00001TQ34,2.0,Year after year they never, EVER have an adult Spider-Man costume that includes gloves and boots.  Is it really that difficult to include those as well?  I mean, come on!
B00001TQ34,3.0,I took a gamble with sizing. I ordered this costume in XLG. I sure glad I did. I brought this for my teenage son who is slender build. That wears a man's medium 32-34 waist pants. The XLG fit him perfect. He's 5'9. The pants was a little high water. He did wear it over pants and shirt. I'm assuming that this outfit suppose to be form fitting.  This costume definitely needs the gloves and boot covers. It was a hit. Everyone loved it.
B00001TQ34,4.0,I ordered this for my boyfriend for Halloween. It runs a bit small but he was like a giddy little kid when he put it on and got compliments all night.
B00001TQ34,2.0,A one time, maybe 2 uses you will get as the fabric is inferior; has many "runs" - like in your nylon stockings, so there is no repairing that can be done to it.  Seems to be made the same as a childs' costume only bigger?  For an adult we expected it would have been manufactured with a higher quality fabric/design.
B00001TQ34,5.0,I'M NOT EVEN 6 FEET TALL AND THE COSTUME FIT PERFECT, THE LITTLE MEN THAT COMPLAIN CAUSE IT WAS TOO BIG FOR THEIR 6 FOOT BODY WAS WRONG, I'M 190 POUNDS 5 FEET 11 IN. AND IT FIT SNUG. THANKS AMAZON
B00001TZYK,1.0,This is stupid because I place my order yesterday and I paid 25 dollars more for it to come in one day and now they ARE GOING TO DELIEVER IT ON NOVEMBER 4th this is insane if I were you guys I don't recommend this seller full of crap goodbye
B00001TZYK,5.0,I love this costume. The quality is great compared to other costumes I've purchased. It will need to be hung for a few days prior to wearing it to allow the skirt & underlay to smooth out. Happy with the purchase.
B00001TZYK,1.0,This outfit went straight back! The material was very cheap. I was looking for something better quality and this was not it!
B00001TZYK,2.0,The costume states it is a 12-14 size. I am a size 8-10 and it took two people to get it over my head. Then it was so tight and uncomfortable. And it is itchy. Other than that it is a cute costume.
B00001TZYK,1.0,Piece. of. Crap.Honestly, this looked nothing like the picture and it definitely was not worth the money. Materials are cheap, skirt poofs out way too much, the top portion is not flattering, etc. etc. Not happy.
B00001TZYK,3.0,Dimensions are all wrong for someone who is petite. Skirt if too long if you are 5'5 or shorter....it will be below your knees. The top is probably for a size 8 person and can't really make any alterations because of the skirt. Just not a good outfit for anyone who is not a size 8 or 10 and shorter that 5'6
B00001TZYK,3.0,The disguise is pretty cute, but it runs a bit small.  I'm typically a 6 to 8, or a medium, but in  this case I order a large taking into account that most of the time the measurements are for a child, but this outfit said, &#34; adult large&#34;,  no way this is a large.  It runs small.  I'm glad I ordered a large instead of a medium.
B00001TZYK,3.0,What you see is what you get. It's not constructed wonderfully, but it does the job for a costume party. I am a size 4/6 and it fit. Most of all, I have a 3 and 7 year old and they LOVED that Mommy was Minnie Mouse.
B00001TZYK,5.0,I wore this costume to "match" my 2 yr old daughter, who was also dressed as Minnie Mouse for Halloween. With the right accessories it could be sexy enough for an adult costume party, but worn with opague black leggings, it was fine for being around kids, too. I am 5'4 and a size 6 or 8 and it fit perfectly. I would not order this if I were very tall because the skirt would be super-short on someone leggier than me. I think, though, that it could have gone up to a size 10 without being too tight. (The main place size matters is your waist measurement, so if you've got a small waist you can wear it even if your hips are large.) It's not very comfortable or durable, but of course it is a Halloween costume! Perfect for wearing once or twice a year.
B00001TZYK,5.0,GREAT COSTUME..RECEIVED SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THIS COSTUME..GREAT QUALITY...GREAT FIT, AND I AM A SIZE 4/6...
B00001TZYK,4.0,I purchased this for Halloween because we were also going to the Disney Halloween Party at DIsneyland and I wanted to be a Disney character. I'm 7 months pregnant and saw that another reviewer was able to wear this while pregnant so I figured it was a safe bet. It definitely fits my pregnant stomach and doesn't end up riding too high. I'm 5'5 and it goes to about mid thigh. It's a cute costume and given my circumstances I'd buy it again. The quality however isn't the best and after wearing it once the white netting on the skirt started to rip and gets caught on this easily. I don't think it would really be in good enough condition to wear another year but for this year it worked well.
B00001TZYK,3.0,bought it for its price,  not necessarily a bad product but I was looking for a bit more of an adult costume.
B00001TZYK,5.0,I bought this for my high school daughter to wear to school for &#34;Wear Your Favorite Character&#34; Day during spirit week.  She loved the costume.  It was very cute on her.  I loved it because it was cut discreetly enough to cover everything that needed covered.  She is a size 9 and this fit her perfectly.  The skirt was a modest length which made me very happy.  I would not expect this to hold up with much use though.  It is well sewed, but the fabric is not the most durable.  I can see it easily ripping out after just a few wears.  I have not washed it and would guess it would not hold up well through a washing based on looking at it and the feel of the fabric.
B00001TZYK,5.0,I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a Minnie costume. This was the cutest and made my daughters play very memorable! Was totally awesome. The costume fir perfect, ears were all glittery and made the costume and night very memorable. You will not be sorry.. The fastest shipping ever..
B00001TZYK,5.0,I bought this for my daughter and this costume is everything that it says it would be! It looked adorable on her and she felt like a million bucks I highly recommend it!!!
B00001TZYK,4.0,I adore this costume. I am a size 2 normally and weight 126 pounds. I am also 21 weeks pregnant. The waist of this costume comes just under the chest so my growing stomach is not an issue. The sleeves are slightly tight, but the rest fits perfectly. I honestly don't know how it could fit someone above a 4 or 6. It is perfect for me and simply adorable, but if you're larger than a 6, I wouldn't risk it.
B00001TZYK,2.0,Just like 95% of the costumes on the market, the material is cheap. Not quite sure where the sizing came from. My wife who is between a medium and large depending on the brand said there is no way this is even a size 12.
B00001TZZN,4.0,loved this costume. I wore it to work and in our Christmas parade. Everybody loved it. The dress is very thin and the wig was a little mismade, but it was fine.
B00001TZZN,5.0,My mother wore this at our Halloween parade at our school.  My sister and I were dalmations.  We looked great
B00001TZZN,4.0,Wig fit great.  Didn't even need bobby-pins to hold it in place.  Rest of the costume simple but good. Would recommend.
B00001TZZN,4.0,This costume was a good purchase.  The wig was excellent! the stole and gloves also perfect. The dress, not so much, very thin and fairly cheap. But, I just used one of my own black dresses.  All in all, great deal for the money.  I purchased this in early Sept. before the prices went up in October.. Arrived just when it said it would..would order from again.
B00001TZZN,4.0,Bought as a costume for trip to WDW. Dress very cheap made. Wig ok. Wrap very small. Barely will go around me
B00001TZZN,4.0,The black dress was VERY cheap and not usable at all but fortunately I had a black dress that worked.  I did like the stole, gloves and wig.  I was complemented on my &#34;authentic&#34; costume many times over Halloween.
B00001TZZN,5.0,I am 5' 7&#34;.  The costume was a perfect fit and very easy to wear.  True to size and my children loved it
B00001U00V,1.0,This looks absolutely nothing like the mask that we received for our son's Dracula Halloween costume.  The mask we received is a greenish/grey color with barely visible lips and unimpressive fangs.  It is also extremely wide for a child's mask.  My son is so disappointed, as am I.  Do not waste your money with this mask.  It is a poor rip-off.
B00001U00Y,4.0,i am 5'1&#34; and 125 pounds and the costume fit me pretty well for the most part.  i had to take in a few spots here and there, but overall i am happy with it.  it has built in panties, which i ultimately cut out and found some pink booty shorts to wear under it. (they were grannie panties and sagged in the rear end)  for the price i thought it was still a good buy.
B00001U00Y,3.0,My fiance dressed up as Captain Nelson- We had so many photo requests! Everyone loves Jeannie. The only thing wrong was that the behind area was enormous. I had to modify it with my sewing machine.
B00001U00Y,5.0,This costume was perfect, it fit like it was made for me. I'm 5'4". 143lbs, DD.I got so many compliments. Women were coming up and asking if their husbands could get their pic taken with me. Too funny! Had a blast! Item was delivered on time in perfect condition. Very comfortable too.
B00001U00Y,3.0,The product was delivered on time.  My first impression was that it was cheaply made, some of the seams were coming apart, the top is is made of foam.  However it fit ok (I am 5'10, 145 lbs) it was a little big but long enough, so I did some sewing to make it fit alittke bit tighter.  I trimmed off extra material to make it look better and then glued rhinstones over all of the trim.  I cut a hole in the hat so that my pony tail would fit thru and hold the hat on my head.  I spray painted an old pair of strappy heels and made them bling.  Decorated a bottle too.  It was cute and not too expensive.
B00001U00Y,3.0,It is cheaply made, and looks it. If you are on the thin side this is NOT for you. I wouldn't buy this again.
B00001U00Y,5.0,I got this costume years ago and I have used it for a variety of occasions, it is just a fun costume to wear.  The hip patches are covered with a mesh, so, even though you freeze a little bit wearing this in late October, it isn't that bad!  ^_^  It is a lot of fun and is always a hit :)
B00001U01I,1.0,First its funny, Its not mention if it is for boys or girls. its not comfortable. Finally its was not what I expected.
B00001U02K,3.0,Sword is flimsy and easy to break. Not good for playing or anything. Broke the same night my child received it.
B00001U02K,2.0,I really searched for a decent samurai sword for my son's halloween costume on line and was willing to pay more for it. This seemed to be the best I could find. it was inexpensive but cheaply made. The sword does not fit back into the sheath properly. I saw plenty of similar items at local stores like party city and Halloween express and would recommend you settle on one of them to save the shipping cost.
B00001U075,4.0,Not exactly as described - the version received was slightly different from what arrived. the neckline and head piece were different.
B00001U075,2.0,I did not recieve the white collar, probably the most important part, no finished hems, everything just chopped off, do not have time to return, but I will definitely request some money back. Also it had white animal hair all over it, so I'm sure it was a return already.  Would NEVER recommend to anyone.
B00001U075,1.0,I am an actor and since I am playing a nun in a scene I needed a nun costume.  Even though it arrived quickly, the outfit is not the same as the picture shown.  The collar is very small, not the size pictured, in fact, it looks like a child's bib.  The head piece is also different from the picture shown.  The only thing that was right is the size, as I will be wearing street clothes under the costume, I needed the full figure robe.  I'll make it work for the scene, but I am very disappointed in the product.
B00001U075,4.0,Well, you do get what you pay for, as this is a packaged costume.Edges are not finished, and a long shower to steam it or a quick wash will get most of the wrinkles out, but not all. I do not have an iron, so I don't know.A bit of interfacing would help the collar and I had a head band on to help support the veil. I had bobby pins close but did not need them as the head band is a non-slip.I recommend to take a normal pin and find a Catholic symbol, or go anti with something not, anarchy anyone?Anyhow, I am 5'4" and this was a bit long for me but that is normal when I go to Plus size costumes.  The black dress can be reused for many costumes, just add different collars, head covers, or belts, etc.
B00001U07B,5.0,This is a great garment,flowing and it is nice,amazon is a great place too shop,they have met alllll my needs,they tell you what to expect when you get the items they be exaxtly the way they told you it would be,why complain,when you ordered it
B00001U07B,3.0,Costume itself was a hit but I wish it was more true to size.  My husband is 6'1&#34;, 210 LB so I ordered the PLUS size.  It was still a little slim fitting and shorter than I'd hoped but it worked.
B00001U07B,1.0,I'd give it no stars if it were an option. "Plus" size not even in the ball park. Can fit a tall 15 year old with 1 1/2 ft. arm length each. Maybe. Material is like stretched-out spandex. And the best part is when I asked to return, they said they don't return in the month of October. I didn't even order this for Halloween. I can understand final sales in a store you can walk into and try the darn thing on, but this is mail order, people. You can exchange but you cant return? I ordered the last plus size, there IS NOTHING ELSE I can return it for that is bigger!!! Geez! I will never order again from this seller.
B00001U07B,2.0,Very poorly made.  Plus size it is not, if you are large, it will be too small.  does not fit well around the neck.  Would not buy again.
B00001U07B,1.0,The only positive I have about this purchase is the prompt shipping.  Aside from that the costume is ST8T GARBAGE!  I probably could have made it myself.  Material SUCKS, construction SUCKS and it did not come with the hat.  They did admit to not including the cross but still I feel it was misrepresented!  Good thing I have a back up!  Ali G!  Wag Wahn!
B00001U07M,3.0,This costume is of semi-decent material and is a one size fits all.  Needs some sort of ironing to get wrinkles/fold lines from being in a bag out.
B00001U07M,5.0,One of the best costumes I ever had! the size is perfect and it was so comfortable! WE LOVED IT
B00001U07M,5.0,fits great. For the money is a great bargin .JUST AS DECCRIBED IN AD. can not wait for hallowenn. thanks
B00001U07U,2.0,We were trying to find a full apron Dorothy costume.  In the picture, it appeared that this was an authentic Dorothy costume.  However, it was the same as the Halloween costume that can be bought in stores with only a front side to the apron vs how it appears in the advertisement photo.  Returned costume and received refund from seller.
B00001U07U,4.0,For Halloween me and my friends are being wizard of Oz characters and I am being dorothy. I ordered this costume it came quickly but it turned out a little different than the picture. The dress ended up being long in my opinion because it is a little farther than my knees, the top is little big on me and it is really wrinkly so I will have to iron it. The fabric has good quality and for $27 it was a good deal were I found it at other stores for $40! Also the waist band is elastic so if your not sure that you will fit in a size remember the waist is elastic! I would recommend this for people who want to save money and and who don't mind having too sow a little if needed for you.
B00001U07U,4.0,Item is great, quality is great, but size information is not clear and became an issue, item was way too large for user
B00001U07U,5.0,Nice fit my daughter was happy with the way the costume fitted I would recommend your comanpy to others thanks
B00001U07U,5.0,Great buy! Didn't expect much after reading the reviews but it was perfect (especially for the price) and it fit well!
B00001U07U,3.0,The turtle neck and sleeves are awkwardly small while the bust is awkwardly large. The costume itself is great but know you'll probably have to make some kind of alterations.
B00001U07U,1.0,I ordered the wizard of OZ costume thinking it would look like the picture.  As I was going to wear it to work.  I work with special needs children and thought this would be a good costume, as it does not look too revealing.  What I received was completely different.  It was a short revealing costume and not at all appropriate.  I am very disappointed with the costume and this company.
B00001U07U,3.0,The only size available was 'standard' not sure what that ment, but I figured i'm average on size (8) so it should fit.The arms are tight, the back won't stay closed by the neck (velcro) so I have to figure something else out so I can wear it. The underskirt is scratchy, but I will be wearing a petticoat underneath it. Overall its cute, but I will have to make some adjustments to the sleeve and back
B00001U07U,5.0,This costume was adorable! The sleeves were a bit tight, and the size of the neck was a bit small, but overall the sizing was pretty accurate, and comfortable.
B00001U07U,3.0,This costume is cute, but the slip underneath is so itchy...you could die.  Also, the waistline on it is made for women about 5 feet tall.  I am 5'7 and the waistline ended up under my breasts.  They made the costume for women without a torso (mine is of normal size).
B00001U07U,5.0,The costume was cute as can be especially for the money.  I was a hit at the party!  And easy to get off and on.
B00001U07U,3.0,I ordered the standard size costume and received the plus size. I didn't have enough time to return the costume, but it had enough elastic that it didn't look totally ridiculous. The costume was very itchy and scratchy, I had wear a camisole and shorts underneath to save my skin.
B00001U07U,1.0,Like the other reviews. I agree with what they say about this item. Try another, my next halloween costume will be something different.
B00001U07U,1.0,Quality was very poor.  One button was missing, style was not as shown.  Hated it so much, I couldn't wear it.  Delivery was fast, but overall I am extremely disappointed, and would not order again.
B00001U07U,2.0,We ordered the dorothy adult costume last week for a show this weekend.  The costume was listed as being adult size standard (fits 8-10) but when the costume arrived it was labeled "teen"  There is no way it would have fit an adult.  Fortunately it was for my teenage daughter and it just barely fit.  BUyer Beware--this costume is very small.  The manufacturer is Rubies Company.  The shipper was lynx-lair.com. It looks like this same costume is sold by several of the vendors.
B00001U07U,3.0,Turn around time was very good for this item...which was very important, since I needed it in a short amount of time.  BUT I was very disappointed in the quality of the costume.  First, the style of the costume I received was not as pictured.  The skirt was very short and poofy and the bodice was completely different. It is a good thing that I sew because I had to take the skirt off and use part of it for a waistband to make it longer. In addition...one of the straps had the gingham going on an angle and the other one had the gingham going straight... unfortunatley I just had to go with it because I only had a few days.  After all I had to do to alter the costume, I really wish I would have just sewed it from scratch.  It would have been cheaper and would have been a better quality.
B00001U07U,2.0,The costume is the perfect look however, the sizing if way off.  I ordered a large to be safe and it was still tight to the point where it was uncomfortable.  The bands around the arm were made for a medium.  I had to wear shorts and a tank top underneath since the elastic wasteband was so uncomfy.  I had my costume on for 2 hrs max and had to change to be able to enjoy my party.
B00001U07U,5.0,exactly as described,  well put together--lasting and perfect for the wizard of oz type of themed event--received promply and well packaged
B00001U07U,1.0,I received this item and it smelled like weed. I opened it and it made my whole apartment smell like weed. I was volunteering at a childrens carnival and had to hurry and find a costume because this one was unsatisfactory. And the company is saying they wont let me refund it because the smell is my fault. Terrible buy.  Will NEVER purchase from Rubies Costume Co AGAIN!
B00001U07U,2.0,Costume came quickly but is completely different than the photo and much cheaper looking. Also much shorter and one of the reasons I ordered this was because the skirt did not look short and poofy. Not enough time to send back with the Halloween party so close. Really disappointed in how I was misled based on the pic as it does not represent the actual product you receive.
B00001U07U,5.0,i got this costume and made my own ruby slippers and made a killing at the halloween party at my work. My only issue was the arms were  a bit tight so i had to cut the seam under the arm so it wouldn't rip
B00001U07U,4.0,the fit was good but the sleeves are very tight. I had to cut them on the seam because it felt like the circulation was being cut off in my arms. I had to wear a t-shirt underneath because the waistline was very itchy. Otherwise I really liked it and got great comments on it
B00001U07U,5.0,We were very pleased with the costume.  My daughter had her heart set on a Dorothy costume for Halloween.  She is 9, but very tall for her age.  We went to 3 different costume shops.  All we could find were "Sexy Dorothy" costumes or costumes for children 5 or under.  This one fit her fine and looked great.  They are cut a little skimpy.  So, if you're not sure which size to get, I recommend going for the bigger size.
B00001U07U,5.0,I got this for my daughters birthday.She listens to it all the time.It was one of her favorite gifts. Thank You
B00001U07U,3.0,I ordered the standard size, which is fine.  The only complaint I have is that the arms are a little tight.  I am size 10 and the arms are snug.  Also, the straps do not go all of the way around the back.  So, visually, it looks a little strange from the back.  But, for less than $30, I am not going to complain.
B00001U07U,4.0,This proved to be one of the better costumes we've ever enjoyed. It was a big hit in the neighborhood, too.
B00001U07U,2.0,I just got this. It is really not for an adult. It should be labeled "teen" only. The torso is not long enough for an adult. the petticoat was jutting out in odd places from the skirt (poorly made). The bust was too tight. Even though I ordered large, it was too small. The price was steep for the quality.
B00001U07U,2.0,SIZE ALERT: The website doesn't tell you this, but the Standard size fits up to Size 12. I'm a 14 and it was extremely tight. My arms did not fit through the sleeves, which are not adjustable. If you're a 12, I would recommend the Large instead. Also, the costume does not look like the picture. It's all one piece and the straps come down much lower than the picture. The quality of the costume material is good, but the waist line hit me just below the chest. I don't know what torso this costume was designed for because it was way too short and made me look twice the size I am. I had to drop out of my company's costume contest because it didn't fit, and it wasn't alterable. It was wasted money.
B00001U07U,4.0,The outfit came on time and looked just like the real thing. It was good quality.
B00001W0F2,5.0,I was very pleased with this purchase! Not only does it fit my child well but it is made well and should endure more than a month or two of play.  My son was/is thrilled with it and that's enough for me.
B00001W0F2,4.0,I got this for my nephew for Christmas. He's been wearing it quite a lot and it seems to be holding together well. He's 4 and half and it's about the right size. The face mask isn't great as he says it's very hot and little difficult to breathe. Appart from that it's great.
B00001W0F2,5.0,I bought this costume for my 4 year-old's birthday. He requested a Spider-man dress up outfit. I saw this outfit and thought it would be perfect. And it was!! He loves it and never wants to take it off. I was worried about the mask fitting completely over his face and blocking his airway but it doesn't seem to interfere with his breathing. I do however make him take it off for air more often just for my own comfort.
B00001W0F2,1.0,cut small, a very disappointed little boy. Fit to tight to enjoy. No uniformity in sizes; will not buy costumes on line again.
B00001W0F2,5.0,My 3-year old is a thrilled with his costume. Promotes creativity, exercise and imagination. Well made. Appreciate the half mask for preschool safety!
B00001W0F2,5.0,This costume is super cute and my grandson loves wearing it. I am very happy with this purchase and its construction.
B00001W0F2,4.0,This costume is very well made (for a costume.) The stitching is good (no holes or loose thread), material is strong & stretchy (comfortable), & my son loves it. The mask is a little hard to breathe thru, but, hey it's Spiderman, it's supposed to be close to your face. My son just lifts the mask up when he wants to. It did come with spats, but I ordered the 'one size fits most' gloves separate. A little expensive, but everything is now days. :) This was a good buy, and I would do it again.
B00001W0F2,5.0,too eager to have costume and over paid, but grateful these companies exsist when you need a costume in another month other october!
B00001W0F2,4.0,My three year old daughter LOVES Spider-Man! She loved wearing the costume.  The only negative is how cheaply they are made. It isn't the distributors fault.
B00001W0F2,1.0,My son is 11-years-old and wears a 12-slim pants. The description claims they are for 11-14 but the packaging says 12-14. At any rate, this costume is so tight on him it's embarrassing even without using the spongey chest and abs insert. And he's a skinny kid. Also, the mask is made out of some type of spongey material. I think an elastic cloth would've been a better choice. He can't even wear the mask because he can't breath with it on and it smooshes his nose. If your child is maybe 9- or 10-years-old, this might be a good choice, however.
B00001W0F2,1.0,My son purchased this with his own money, and was so excited for it to arrive.  However, it contained ONLY the jumpsuit, but NOT the hood, chest piece, or shoe covers.  It clearly states on the description AND on the bag itself that these things should be included.
B00001W0F2,5.0,TSpiderman Muscle Costume, Size: Child S(4-6)This was a gift for my 5 year old nephew on his 5th birthday. The theme was Spiderman.  He loved it so much that he wears it to sleep.  Thanks Amazon.
B00001W0F2,1.0,I purchased this costume because it said it included shoe covers.  That's all my son talks about....needing shoe covers!  When it came, it was a regular costume with no shoe covers.  I'm sure the costume itself is fine, but I did not get what I paid for.When I sent a complaint e-mail, I received no response from this seller.
B00001W0F2,1.0,This beautiful costume was a birthday gift for my 5 yr old grandson. On Day 1, the stitching started coming out. By Day 9, the zipper was broken, the muscles were ruined and the costume had been mended three times. I strongly advise against this purchase. It is beautiful but not designed to be worn.
B00001W0F2,3.0,The over all quality of this costume was very good.  My grandson was thrilled with it.  My only concern was that it has limited breathing space and he became a little breathless after wearing the outfit for a while.
B00001W0F2,4.0,I got this for my nephew last Christmas and he absolutely loved it. I was pleased with the quality.  The ONLY problem I had was that I had to buy the gloves separately.  When you are dealing with a child that is really into costumes like my nephew, they want every single piece. So it would have been nice to have the gloves included. :)
B00001W0F2,3.0,The quality wasn't tjhe greatest but also not the worst I've seen either. Little advise to pass on is that it tends to run alot smaller than you assume my son wears a 10 and I bought it a little big so he could have room and it just barely fit so don't purchase if it is supposed to be a exact fit.
B00001W0F2,4.0,Bought the costume for my nephew so he can have a costume for a Marvel party we're throwing.  He loved it, he never took it off, and didn't complain about the mask as I thought he would.  Only downside was that it doesn't come with gloves or socks.  But besides that it is great.
B00001W0F2,3.0,My dad bought this for my 6 year old son for halloween. My son already had a black that he likes more. He wore this one when it was new once but switched back to the black costume that he loves.
B00001W0F2,5.0,My son got this for Christmas and he wears it all the time. He loves it. The detailing is great.
B00001W0GC,5.0,Sizes run a bit small. Very detailed, but no tail. Easy wear, kids Love it.
B00001W0GC,4.0,It was just as it was described, exactly what I expected. It does run a little small, though. My son's two and it fit him just right. And I wish the ears stood up like in the picture. They kind of just flop down. Other than that, very cute costume
B00001W0GC,5.0,It was a little bit small than I thought, but  it fitted and we were very satisfied. I would recommend to buy for a three year old child.
B00001W0GC,4.0,This is a very cute costume and it fit my son perfectly! Just keep in mind, the material is extremely thin. I had to dress him in extra layers, so allow in size for that.
B00001W0GC,5.0,VERY CUTE COSTUME! For Halloween my son is going as mickey Mouse and My daughter as Minnie Mouse. The costumes are really cute together! Good quality, nothing itchy or bothersome. Bought the 3t-4t which fits my some what husky 3 year old very well, and my petite 4 year old, just as well.
B00001W0GC,4.0,This Mickey Mouse costume was adorable. My only recommendation would be to find a different set of ears or to sew some pipe cleaners to the back of these. The little ears on the top of the bonnet flopped forward and couldn't really be seen. Also, the bonnet was a little small for my 3-year old's head.
B00001W0GC,3.0,Order a size 4 for my 2 yr old, little bit small overall It was good but wish they could add a zipper to the back.
B00001W0GC,5.0,The size was a little smaller than expected and the fabric not very durable but my son was a very happy Mickey Mouse for trick or treat! Thank You!
B00001W0GC,4.0,My 2 yr old, who turns 3 in January, is short for his age and fit into this costume. So I would say these costumes definitely run small! It's a one piece jumpsuit and seems pretty comfortable. The ears are definitely floppy, they don't stand up at all. I'm sure it is an easy fix though!
B00001W0GC,3.0,My son loves Mickey Mouse so this made the perfect Halloween costume. He would not wear the ears at all because they were so tight.  The entire costume runs small, but the ears were the most noticeable. I ended up purchasing an additional pair that was a headband instead of a hat and he wore those without a problem.
B00001W0GC,2.0,The hat is does not fit well.  It's so small and my son is only 20 months old.  The suit though is not bad, also the ears don't stay up and just fall flat.
B00001W0GC,5.0,This costume was great!  It is super cute!  My son just turned 2 in August and this was the perfect size for him.  I would highly recommend this costume.
B00001W0GC,4.0,I ordered this costume for my 3 1/2 year old son for halloween in a size 4-6.  I had looked at the manufacturers size chart, figured this costume would fit, and still have room to wear winter clothing underneath for trick or treating...I was wrong.  This costume was very cute, but just fit him.  It was very difficult to get on and off, and there was definitely no room for anything except a very thin layer of clothing underneath.  Luckily, it was very warm this year for Halloween, and we didn't have to worry about it.  Also, the Mickey ears don't stand up like they do in the picture...they just flop over.
B00001W0GC,5.0,My two-year-old LOVES Mickey Mouse so he FLIPPED when he saw his costume!  It was a huge hit.  The costume is well made and very good quality.
B00001W0GC,5.0,Our grandchild loved this outfit and wore it for several days.  We were excited that it fit him perfectly and he was adorable in it.
B00001W0GC,5.0,Super cute costume!  The only problem was the length.  I don't think the costume was true to size.  My son looked great in it, but it was really short.  I just put on black knee socks, so it looked like it was supposed to be that way!
B00001W0GC,1.0,I ordered this costume for my five-year-old, 46 lb, size 5T, 43 inch tall son, and it is horribly small. I am so disappointed since we just got it today and Halloween is next week. If you have a 2-3 year old, this costume might work, but it will definitely not fit the size stated on the costume guide.
B00001W0GC,3.0,While my three year old loved this costume and he looked adorable, it ran very small. Lucky for us the weather was decent because he couldn't wear anything under it. Also the ears while cute they were kindof strange, it looks like they tie but one side is connected to the head part with velcro and kept pulling off when we tried to tie it. Overall it was really cute and the only good mickey costume available. He's an average 3 year old and it was very small.
B00001W0GC,4.0,My son loved this costume.  I only had one issue and that was the fabric easily picked up pet hair.
B00001W0GC,3.0,Isn't true to size. I bought this for my 5 year old who is small for his age (height and size) and the legs are too short. The ears don't stay on too well either. I'll still be using the costume, but I wasn't that impressed by it.
B00001W0GC,1.0,I am extremely disappointed with this product.  The sizing guide says it will fit sizes 4-6x.  My son just turned 4 and is on the small size.  It doesn't come close to fitting him.  I ordered it for him for his birthday, and because I ordered early, I can't return it.  I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I am.  I will never purchase from this vendor again.
B00001W0GC,5.0,My nephew wanted to be Mickey Mouse for Halloween so bad.  I could not find one at all in the stores, so I went to my AMAZON and had it sent right to the house.  He was the happiest little kid in the world thank you for having this costume on your website,  (he still puts it on and plays with it to this day !!!  A BIG THANK YOU !!!!!
B00001W0GC,1.0,My order never arrived on time, I tryed to contact UPS but they dont answer calls.Amazon doesnt allow to file a claim with this type of orders, so be ready to lose your time and your money.
B00001W0GC,4.0,This is a great Mickey Mouse costume. It is one piece for easy on/off. My son is a huge Mickey Mouse Club house fan and he was so excited to wear it. I gave it 3 stars because it runs small. My son is an average sized 4 year old, he wears size 5  clothes and we had to squeeze him into the 4-6 when he wore a layer of warm clothes underneath and his pants stuck out the bottom, the ears were similarly small. This costume does not come with shoes or covers so we spray painted an old pair of shoes yellow, and he looked very cute. Don't hesitate to buy this if you have a Mickey Mouse fan in your house
B00001W0GC,1.0,Costume not as pictured - poor quality, overpriced, size information deceiving - my 2 year old "string bean" could not fit into size 4 !- had to break his heart and return to the seller. Did not get my money back nor hear from anybody since over 1 month of returning the costume - will NEVER buy from this seller again!
B00001W0GC,4.0,I bought this for my 2 1/2y/o who is quite small for his age, he normally wears a 2T, I bought a 3-4T & it fits him good. The ears are quite small and don't really stay on very good. It is very cute & seems to be well made. I would suggest buying it as long as you know it does run small. Great price, fast delivery!
B00001W0GC,3.0,Size says 4-6X.  This was way short on my 5 year and we barely got the costume on him.  I would say this is more a 3-4 size.
B00001W0GC,3.0,A bit small overall. Hat/ears very small. But a good costume. If the sizes were good i would recommend it.
B00001W0GC,4.0,The costume fit well but the hat was way too small for our almost 3 year old. I think this fit much more like a 3T. Our son will likely grow out of this within a few months and he wears a 3T comfortably.
B00001W0GC,4.0,I bought a child small for my two year old based on the reviews. It fit him very well with a little room to grow. Really dislike the bonnet it came with so I purchased mickey ears to go with. Overall, good costume, okay quality is a Halloween costume, just buy in a size up since they do run small.
B00001W0GC,1.0,I bought this for my kids birthday a Mickey and Minnie mouse themed birthday party.Too bad that I could only see the front part of this costume. The back part of this really looks like a magician. One guest even commented that he thought my son was playing 'magician&#34;&#8230; It just failed to give the Mickey Mouse appearance.  Also disappointed with the sequins that overall validates the &#34;magician&#34; look. It was also oddly wide on hip area.
B00001W0GC,5.0,This product is true to size for my larger 2 1/2 year old. It is one piece and exactly as I expected for the price. No problems and he has worn it for weeks.
B00001W0GC,5.0,My brother loves his costume. He normally wears a 2T but I ordered the 3T/4T size and it was perfect.
B00001W0GC,3.0,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old and thankfully bought the 4-6 size, it ran really small and was still a little too short!
B00001W0GC,3.0,the costume was in great condition my only complaint was that it is real thin material so my Mickey was cold on halloween night. The ears were big for his head so i just put on his giants hat and put the ears over the hat.
B00001W0GC,3.0,I ordered this costume for my small 3-year-old for Halloween. I ordered the size 4-6 based on other reviews that stated it ran small. I'm so glad I did. To put it into perspective, my son wears 2T in pants and 3T in tops. My biggest complaint is I can't get it on him and I am going to have to attempt to alter it a bit so he can wear it. It is a one-piece suit and has only a small opening on the back to put it on. This means the entire thing has to go on from the bottom up. I got his legs in and managed to pull it past his waist with a little wiggling, but when it came to getting his arms in the sleeves, forget it. I couldn't get his arms in at all because the opening is too small. I just hope I can get it on him later because he freaked out and won't let me near him with it. :( I love the costume. It's very cute and he's going to be adorable, but I'm disappointed that I have to attempt to make the opening bigger at risk of ruining the whole thing.Just wanted to update that I did manage to get it on him for Halloween by opening up the seam on the back by another couple of inches. It looked great. We had trouble with the hat, though. It fit him fine and tied under his chin, but when he talked, the movement pulled the Velcro off the one side. We opted to put on his Mickey ear hat from Disney instead. Overall, the costume did it's job. Definitely runs small and may need a little altering to get it on, but otherwise is fine.
B00001W0GC,5.0,This Mickey Costume was perfect fit for my 4 year old daughter who wanted noting more but to be Mickey Mouse! Only draw back was that we could not get her hat & ears to stay up straight for long.
B00001W0GC,4.0,This costume runs really small and is more likely a 3T than a 4T. It's a little difficult to get off and on, too. I didn't really like the "ears" either. The hat-style ears are really small and the chin strap is uncomfortable. I ended up cutting off the strings and my son can still wear the "ears" part okay. Cute costume though - looked adorable with his little sister as Minnie Mouse on Halloween.
B00001W0GC,4.0,My son adores Mickey and this is a great costume; definitely not a size 4-6. My son is 3 years old, 38 inches and 35 pounds. This costume is very small and barely fits now, I'm hoping it will still fit 6 weeks from now on Halloween.
B00001W0GC,5.0,it was a gift for grandson and he is very happy.  Size of costume ran smaller than what a 4-6X usually does.
B00001W0GC,3.0,The outfit fit, but the ears were made to fit an infant. We had to use our ears from Disneyland!
B00001W0GC,5.0,Cute outfit :) bought the 3T even though my toddler is 2 years old, but it fit him fine. Initially came without the ears, but seller rectified their absence immediately and replaced them.
B00001W0GC,4.0,The hat was very small and the ears did not stand up, but it was cute. If you child wears a 4T go with a larger size.
B00001W0GC,4.0,The ears didn't fit him so I recommend everything else in the costume but the head piece. Great customer service though
B00001W0GC,4.0,I would give it 5 stars had the tail not come off but overall my son loved his costume. It looks very cute!
B00001W0GC,4.0,The hat/ears is a little small compared to the rest of the costume. It fit well enough for my son to wear it trick or treating, but it was snug on his head from the start.
B00001W0GC,1.0,Totally different from the picture, I'm not happy I want my money back... :(And I will retaurn the product
B00001W0GC,1.0,too small, poor quality... the ears dont even fit, a complete waste of money.wish i had returned it, will never purchase a costume or clothing from amazon again.
B00001W0GC,5.0,If your little one loves Micky Mouse as much as my little boy does, you will love this costume! He was so excited. There was enough room for clothes underneath (grant it your little one isn't too big for the size itself). The ears could of maybe be a little bigger for the head but my son has a bigger head anyways. I would defiantly recommend
B00001W0GC,1.0,I have to pay an overcharge so i am very disapoint with your rervice.I have to pay 25 euros.I am very disapointed
B00001W0GC,4.0,Very cute, however Mickey ears hat too small.  I ordered a different set of Mickey ears (like a head band) which will work much better.Minnie costume is darling too!
B00001W0GC,4.0,This costume is so cute!  My son has gotten loads of compliments dressed up as Mickey Mouse this Halloween.  The costume is easy to get on and off even though it is all one piece.  There are nice details with the glitter on the tie and 'buttons' on the pants.  Although this says it is sized S 4-6x, I would guess it is much closer to a size 3T or 4T.  My daughter wears a 6 and there is no way she would ever have been able to get into this costume.  My son, who wore it, is a solid 4T and it JUST fit him.  I was hoping for a little more room since Halloween in Ohio is usually cool and we need to layer up.  Great costume and so much fun!
B00001W0GC,2.0,The costume states that it's a child size 4-6 (small) when in reality it's 4T-6T. Those are two COMPLETELY different sizes. My son looks like pee wee herman in this costume. I called the company and the only way they will refund my money for the full amount is to exchange it for a different product on their website. Otherwise you only get back half of what you paid for. So I went to their website and they literally don't have anything worth my while. So instead I ended up cutting the pants and making them into shorts for my son to wear for Halloween.
B00001W0GC,3.0,My son LOVES MIckey so he's worn this about 5 times already. FIRST it is NOT true to size. Not even close. My son is 3, admittedly he is a very TALL 3 (probably 40, 41 inches) butthis size 4-6 just fits. As it is, they are short in the legs. I will fix that by wearing black socks. It is also a little snug getting on...as in getting his ams in and over his shoulders. So to say this is a size 4-6 is wrong. there is no way a child who wears a size 6 or even a 5 is going to fit in this. SECOND, the ears are a joke. They are some kind of bonnet thing which would fit a baby AND the ears do not even sit up (as in the photo). Beore my son got home we slit them open and stuffed them with a round cardboard AND tissue and they still were not 100% up. We ended up having to buy ears at party city.Aside from those two pretty major things, the costume is really cute. My son loves being Mickey and i guess that is what really matters. The fabric is cheap but aren't all store bought costumes?
B00001W0GC,3.0,The costume is cute but I bought a size that is supposed to fit a 4-6 year old and it is too short for my barely 4 year old who is only average height
B00001W0GC,4.0,Costume is very nice. I did read the reviews before hand and did buy the size 4-6x for my little boy who is almost 3 years old. He is average size and it fit perfect over his clothes.
B00001W0GC,2.0,My rating is low to get the attention of the customer due to "size" alone.  The costume runs very small.  It would fit children size 4 and under, not size 4 to 6.Other than the size being untrue, the material and overall look of the costume is wonderful.
B00001W0GC,1.0,My son is 3 years old and wears a size 3T.  He's about 34 lbs and 37 1/2 inches tall.  He is not tall, or heavy, actually is is on the smaller-side according to my pediatrician.  That said, I bought a size 4-6x, based on the advice in other reviews.  This is waaaay to small.  I will need to return it.  The jumpsuit/costume is exactly the right length for his height, but it is tight all over.  And because the fabric is so flimsy, my son would need to wear street clothes under it, which would make it even tighter.  Also, the ears hat is so small the ties wouldn't reach under his chin!  It looked ridiculous...Like it was made for a doll.  I am not happy with this costume and I will be returning it right away.  I advise not even trying it.  Don't buy it, if your little wants to dress up like Mickey Mouse, find another costume/brand.  This one is terrible.
B00001W0GC,5.0,I bought this for my son for Halloween.  He just turned 2 about 1.5 months ago, and is bordering between size 2T and 3T.  I decided to buy this a little big (rather than small), and I'm glad I did.  This is a size 3T-4T, and it just fits about right.  The ears are WAY too small, though.  I may have to buy a headband with ears instead.  The costume itself is really adorable, and he loves it - just go for a slightly bigger size and plan on buying separate ears.
B00001W0GC,2.0,My 3 year old could not wait to be Mickey Mouse for Halloween.  The day we got this costume was such a disappointment!!  We ordered the size Child S (4-6x).  My son wears a size 4 or 5 in regular clothes.  This costume was so snug (with only a t-shirt and underwear on) - and the hat was so small, my guess is it would only fit a baby.  He wasn't happy, but we had to return it.  So sad.  I should have read the other reviews about the size discrepency before I ordered it.
B00001W0GC,4.0,My son loves this costume.  Great price, bought for halloween but couldnt get it off him.  Very comfortable.  The material is thin so i will put a layer under it in the fall but still a great price for a cute costume!
B00001W0GC,5.0,This was a cute costume for my son who is 3.  He is 40 inches tall and 38lbs and the 4-6 JUST fit him.  The sizes run small.
B00001W0GC,4.0,My son is a huge Mickey Mouse fan so I thought it'd be great if he were Mickey Mouse for Halloween. I looked at some other costume styles, but thought this was very cute as oppose to the others . It fit great and he looked so adorable in it. He really enjoyed being Mickey Mouse for a day or rather a few days!
B00001W0GC,5.0,The hat needs to be a little bigger in the back for it to stay on easier but other then that we loved this costume. Once again great job Amazon. :)
B00001W0GC,5.0,My son wore this for Halloween and looked adorable in it.  We actually found a Mickey Mouse mask for him to wear with it instead of the ears that came with it.
B00001W0GC,4.0,My son loved wearing this costume for Halloween! He typically wears a 2T but I decided to buy this size instead which was a great choice because it fit him great. The only thing I didn't like was that the hat does not fit a toddler's head. It is meant for an infant or I guess a toddler with a VERY small head.
B00001W0GC,4.0,This costume was adorable! Perfect for my 3 year old. He LOVED it. He is usually a 2T/3T and this fit perfectly over his jeans and shirt so I would order it a little big if you trick or treat somewhere cold.
B00001W0GC,1.0,The costume was one piece! My 4 year old grandson would not wear it as it was a &#34;onesie&#34;. It was a pain to even try on by stepping into the neck opening. And not even practical for having to go to the bathroom for him. It needs to be two pieces.
B00001W0GC,5.0,As a last minute purchase for a halloween costume, it was a perfect buy for my grandson..It fit him just right.He got quite a few compliments while he was out trick or treating.
B00001W0GC,4.0,This Mickey Mouse costume is cute, however the sizes are not accurate. My son is 3 and wears a 3T/4T...so I ordered that size (he also is within the height/weight ranges of their size charts). We received the costume and it was way too short in the legs and sleeves. The hat would not even begin to go on his head. So, I ordered the size 4-6 and just received it. It is a better fit, but the legs are still a little short. I recommend the larger size for a typical 3 year old...not sure how it could fit an older child. My son does love the costume :)
B00001W0GC,3.0,I have a 2 1/2 yr old (he is in 3T) and bought the 3T-4T for him the outfit just fits so I hope it's  not too cold b/c I won't be able to put really thick clothes under it.  The hat doesn't even begin to fit so now I have to buy separate ears. It's really cute on. If you're considering this and on the line about the size I suggest going for the larger size.
B00001W0GC,2.0,Bought this for my son's halloween costune. He liked it and he looked cute, but after that it started fraying and unraveliny at the edges. I had to throw it away as he stilk would try to wear it with long strings dangling
B00001W0GC,5.0,Great costume, easy to put on, not complicated, but cute! My 2 yr old grandson wore for Halloween and he loved it
B00001W0GC,1.0,I ordered a size 5 for my 4yr. old. It was tight and barely fit. We did not realize this till it was too late. The had is also way too small. I would say the costume is for a 2-3 yr old.
B00001W0GC,4.0,This &#34;fancy&#34; Mickey Mouse costume was adorable!  Our 2 1/2 year-old loved it.  It was comfortable and fairly easy to get on and off as well.  The only negative was the ears.  They didn't stand up straight, plus my son didn't like the tie under the chin.  We ended up buying separate ears at the party store instead, which worked great.
B00001W0GC,1.0,Poor costume quality and the hat/ears is WAY too small for a 2 year old.  I wasn't expecting much but it looked nicer online.  It will hopefully hold up for the one night it needs to...
B00001W0GC,5.0,My son loves this Mickey costume, I had tons of compliments from other parents how nice the outfit looks, love it.
B00001W0GC,4.0,This costume was great but is definitely NOT a 4-6x size. Our Mickey had highwater pants for Halloween!
B00001W0J3,5.0,i got this outfit for my daugthe'rs first b day she looked cute enough to eat!!!Love it
B00001W0J3,5.0,Fits true to size and is very cute on. Not high quality material but what halloween costume ever is? My daughter looked very adorable and loved the way it felt.
B00001W0J3,4.0,The costume came promptly and was what was expected. The head piece was fragile and broke the moment she touched it. Greatfully we had another set of Minnie ears.
B00001W0J3,5.0,My daughter looked so cute in this costume!! The only negative was the tulle on the sleeves was a little itchy so I just put a long sleeve black shirt under and she was happy :-)Thanks!
B00001W0J3,5.0,I have never written a review before, but wanted to after reading the reviews before I bought this costume. It seemed most people were complaining about the size... but it fit my 18-month old daughter perfectly. She's in the 50th percentile for height and weight, and the costume fit like a glove. It wasn't tight on her arms at all (didn't even leave marks or anything) and I didn't have to cut it. It did differ slightly from the picture, but was super cute anyways. Everyone loved it on her. I googled the costume before purchasing and one of the halloween sites that had the costume had a size chart posted. I would recommend checking that out before buying, just to be sure about the size... but it fit my daughter and she looked great.Also, it was only one piece... so if you are planning on having your little one in the costume for any length of time, diaper changes might be difficult. Since we were only using it for trick-or-treating, it wasn't an issue.
B00001W0J3,5.0,This dress is just like the ad. It fit perfect and my baby girl looked so cute, I'll remember it forever.
B00001W0J3,5.0,I loved this. I used it for a camp Halloween so it was warm outside. Would consider something warmer in cold weather or order size bigger for extra room under it. Sizing seems to be right on!
B00001W0J3,3.0,Very cute costume! My daughter looked adorable. The only problem I had was the headband ears. They were bent weird but worse than that, the headband snapped in 2 and I was stuck
B00001W0J3,1.0,I was very upset when receiving this costume!! It looked NOTHING like the picture!!!  No hood, short sleeved, very cheap.  Now I have to find something else for my 5 month old in 3 weeks and have the hassle of sending it back.
B00001W0J3,5.0,We bought this for my daughter, size 12 months. It ran a little large, but not grossly so. We received a ton of compliments on it, and loved that it was red and not pink.
B00001W0J3,4.0,Used this as my 13 month old's Halloween costume. It was a perfect fit and extremely cute. My daughter wore black leggings with it. It is of course cheaply made since it is a costume but held together well the three times she wore it. The head band broke when my daughter pulled it off her head, but for the price I would still purchase it again.
B00001W0J3,4.0,I wanted to get this for my daughter for  her first halloween this year but I was debating for months after reading all of the mixed reviews on it. My daughter is big for her age. She'll be 1 next week and she is already 24lbs and a little over 30". Alot of people kept complaining about this costume being too small for their kid but if you check the sizing chart you'll be able to see if it will fit your infant or not. 12-18mth says it fit up to 26lbs and 32" so I took a chance and ordered it and it fits her fine. When I opened it I did think it looked small but I tried it in her and it looks good and fit her perfect. If she was any bigger maybe it wouldn't fit. I also added a pair of black tights under the dress and it looks really cute.
B00001W0J3,4.0,My daughter like it...It would be better if it is long sleeve...it's too &#34;Summer&#34; for &#34;Fall&#34; weather here in West Texas...
B00001W0J3,5.0,This costume fit my 12 month old perfectly.  It was totally cute and the &#34;ears&#34; headband was not uncomfortable for my baby's head.  The only complaint I have is that it pulls on from the bottom.  There is no crotch opening for easy diaper changes, so this probably isn't a good costume for wearing more than a couple of hours.  At first, I was not very impressed with the way the stitching shows on the outside, but it turned out not to be a big deal.  It didn't show too much.
B00001W0J3,5.0,I bought this for my 15 month daughter and it fits her perfectly. She is about 21l bs and 31 inc. Quality is ok, not perfect, but she will wear it only once. Item was delivered earlier than expected.
B00001W0J3,5.0,too cute on my niece! purchased for her one year birthday party. It was a total hit and she was the most adorable little minnie!
B00001W0J3,5.0,This is an adorable costume for little kids.  Any little kid is sure to look adorable in this Minnie Mouse costume!  The headband is made to fit most heads.  I like the sequin-y dress.
B00001W0J3,2.0,I bought this for my baby's first birthday. It looks cute on her but there are some details that I don't like. 1st, the elastic bond on the sleeve. 2nd, I think the size wouldn't fit infants beyond 12 months old. My baby will be a year old in less than 2 wks and it just fits her perfectly. 3rd, it would be hard to change a diaper because you need to take off the whole thing. Because of that, I will just have my baby wear it for a couple of picture taking then change her to a different minnie mouse outfit.
B00001W0J3,5.0,I dug this costume out the other day, and decided to write a review (despite it being 9 years later!). I was impressed at how well it its held up. I gave it to my friend and his wife for their daughter and it looks great on her just like it did on my daughter 9 years prior.The material is just what you would expect from a costume: Lightweight, thin, etc. But the best part about it is the headpiece. Its very cute, and why we decided to buy it in the first place. I highly recommend this product over others we saw at places like Walmart and Kmart- and even the specialty costume stores.Again, the headpiece make this costume! And you wont find it on the costumes sold in traditional stores.
B00001W0J3,5.0,We were so happy with the quality of this outfit.  It got here speedy and in excellent shape. Can hardly wait.
B00001W0J3,5.0,My daughter wore this for her first Halloween, and it could not have been cuter.  I got the bigger size because she is very tall for her age, and it fit just fine.  She was 10 months old on Halloween.  I guess the only comment I would make is that she, of course, did not want to leave the ears alone so many of our pictures did not feature the cute ears on top.
B00001W0J3,2.0,A very well made costume, but this really fit closer to a 9 month outfit.  I would really recommend a larger size, especially if using for Trick or Treating, and needing extra layers for warmth.
B00001W0J3,3.0,I bought this because it looks cute with the baby model above. I was bit disappointed  with sleeves  and the material wrapped around the skirt because it looks cheap. The collar came a bit scratched too but because I am running out of time, I have no time to return this. I got what I pay for. I did not like that the diaper area is not accessible, you have to remove the whole dress to be able to change diaper. Overall, from afar my baby looks cute still with this one, not just good when you closely examine it.
B00001W0J3,1.0,It was cute, but too small for my 15 month old, even though she's really tiny. The material felt very scratchy. All in all, not worth the price or the time.
B00001W0J3,5.0,My 16 month old wore this for Halloween this year and was adorable.  The only feedback I would offer future buyers is that this product runs small.  My daughter has been running small for her age in sizes but the size 12-18 month that I bought for her was really snug.
B00001W0J3,2.0,Costume adorable but sequins come off too easily.  By the end of the day half were missing.  I tried to glue some back on when costume was first received but by the time Halloween came and went most had come off.
B00001W0J3,5.0,I ordered this costume for my little one and it fits her perfectly, I was a bit worried due to the other reviews saying it was cut small. But I have no complaints.
B00001W0J3,4.0,The material is thin but most Halloween costumes are made from this material now.Fits great on my 12 month old and looks super cute.
B00001W0J3,4.0,I recived the order in a timley mannor with no problems. The price was cheaper than I had seen on other sites.The qulity was not as good as the disney store, however; it was slightly cheaper. my 1 year old daughter looked very cute and recived many compliments. I would reccomend this product, and company.
B00001W0J3,2.0,I bought this costume for my daughter's first b'day as I was doing Minnie Mouse theme. Material is very very cheap.It looks pretty in picture but when i received it, I was disappointed. Not worth the money I paid. Also, It is tight for my daughter. she usually fits in 12 months clothes, but this one was is very tight. Its wastage of money. I will not recommend to spend 17 bucks on this costume
B00001W0J3,3.0,it's cute just like shows in pix. But the quality is so poor, very hard materials, feel like wearing a paper. The worst part is the elastic ribbon around the sleeves is way tooo tight. My daughter is a regular size 12 mons when we got the 12-18 mons size, it's super tight on her arms and make it red immediately. She seems very uncomfy wearing it, and I personally dun like the black top, looks like a bug in person:) we returned it eventually.
B00001W0J3,5.0,My granddaughter thought it great for my great granddaughter and she didn't even see it on your site. This was great since we had such trouble with the lady bug
B00001W0J3,1.0,the costume looks adorable but its not. its made so cheaply! the sleeves are mesh and so uncomfortable. the bottom of the sleeve had elastic i guess so it can look poofy but it was so tight on her arms it made a mark. i had to return it. the skirt part had no body to it. it had no tafeta. i dont recommend it. i ended up buying one drectly from disney store and that one was soooooooooo adorable!!
B00001W0J3,4.0,This product arrived really fast, and it looks great on my daughter.  I gave it 4 stars because the material is a little flimsy, but I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
B00001W0J3,5.0,I order this in size 12-18 months and I was worried after seeing the reviews that it fits small. My daughter is 22 months and weighs 24 pounds and it fits perfect with room to grow!
B00001W0J3,4.0,Cute outfit, my daughter likes it and wears it still sometimes to play. It's easy to put on and looks adorable on small kids.
B00001W0J3,5.0,We bought this outfit for our daughter for Halloween and she looked absolutely adorable! She didn't like the cap but that's because she doesn't like caps in general! Otherwise, it was a big hit!
B00001W0J3,5.0,Because its that damm good !!! And I'm very happy with it a and I got every thing I wanted
B00001W0J3,5.0,have a 1 year old granddaughter....this one is great and fits fine....too cute for words...you are ok on buying this deal...
B00001W0J3,4.0,This dress fit my little girl perfectly for her Minnie Mouse themed first birthday! It was a hit with all the guests and the price was just right. Now speaking of the price, this dress would have gotten 5 stars if it were not for the little red dots on the top part of the dress coming off every where. But for how much your paying its still not a deal breaker or anything, a run of the vacuum, a bath and those are taken care of. Also the headband fit a lot better than I had hoped to over all I was very pleased with this dress set.
B00001W0J3,2.0,My 18 month old daughter was very uncomfortable in this outfit.  I cut the elastic on the arms for extra room, but the material was still too scratchy.  I thought it ran really small, as she is very petite as it is.  The price and look were great, but not practical for a young toddler.
B00001W0J3,4.0,It gets destroyed in the wash. More of a one time use type of outfit. Maybe hand wash it to avoid any damage.
B00001W0J3,2.0,This was very cute on my daughter but was very, very cheap. All the material was super thin as well. I would not buy this again and would not recommend it.
B00001W0J3,5.0,I bought this for my daughter for Halloween and it was exactly what I was looking for. She was comfortable and the material was light.
B00001W0J3,5.0,It was the perfect costume for my granddaughter on her first halloween she looked absolutely adorable
B00001W0J3,5.0,A great costume, my 18th mos. old looked so adorable in it. She loves it so much she wears it around the house even after Halloween!
B00001W0J3,5.0,the costume fits perfect, im so inlove with it my neace loved it she wears it all the time. :)
B00001W0J3,5.0,Very cute costume, easy to put on, got it for my 9 month old granddaughter and it was adorable. Get larger size
B00001W0J3,5.0,Purchased for my 18mo old for Halloween and it fit good and she didn't squirm around in it.  Too Cute on.
B00001W0J3,5.0,This was an outfit for my youngest granddaughters birthday it looked and fit her beautifully! Thank you so much for the quick mailing also!!!
B00001W0J3,4.0,This costume was super cute on my little girl, but the sequins kept falling off and the headband came apart. (I was able to fix it with super glue) She is 17 months old and about 23 pounds and it was a bit snug on her. If your child is any bigger I would definitely suggest the next size up. All that being said the price was great, the shipping was fast and it is an adorable costume!
B00001W0J3,4.0,This costume was just as cute as the picture and surpringly, it was pretty good quality. We really loved it. Although, the ears were a bit big for my 16 month old (I bought the 12-18 size) but luckily had other ears and I just wore hers, which she loved. I had already assumed she wouldn't wear the ear bc she can't deal with anything on her head these days.
B00001W0J3,4.0,My daughter was just a touch petite for her age of 22 months when she wore this for Halloween last year.  It fit fine, even with the addition of a white turtleneck and black tights.  Not only did those help for warmth, but it looked great AND helped prevent any scratchiness from the many unfinished edges on the underside of the costume.  A quality product, this is not, but it *is* very cute on, and served it's purpose as a costume for the night.  In fact, she still plays with the headband (which is also absolutely adorable as well).
B00001W0J3,3.0,This costume is very cute BUT it runs really small. My daughter is VERY small for  her age and I had to cut the elastic in the arms bc it was so tight. Also not very warm but we made due. Just easier buying things like this in a store so you can return easier but lesson learned. It is adorable though.
B00001W0KA,5.0,This is the cutest buzz lightyear costume I've ever seen. My son was obsessed. We got so many compliments on Halloween. We also bought the blow up jet pack. The costume wouldn't have been complete without it. The jet pack was my 4 year old sons favorite part.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Its soft enough not to irritate, and flexible enough to fit well. My boy was thrilled so we are too. Hope it fits this halloween again. Buzz is his favorite.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Fit great...and pretty neat looking.  He got lots of compliments, and he LOVES playing with it still.  Definitely buy the wings and the helmet - the gloves were way too big and not really needed. Glad I bought this, he loved it....
B00001W0KA,3.0,The Suit is too smal for the 3 year old, The Purchase was made for a size big enough to fit a 4 year old, the suit is good quality make just too small if I were to order again I would order a much bigger age group to ensure a fit. The Child loves it but is squeezed into it.
B00001W0KA,1.0,This costume did not fit right. My son hated it and would not wear it for Halloween. It's very ackward the way the head piece goes on. Would definitely not recommend this item. Go to the Disney store and buy the real thing.
B00001W0KA,5.0,It is very good quality for the price.  My nephew wears a 3T and it fit perfect! It looks better than the ones sold at Party City.
B00001W0KA,3.0,Costume is 3T-4T, but like some people mentioned its smaller. I ordered it for my son who is 4T and its short on the arms. But its not returnable (didnt purchase at amazon) and he can wear it, so we are keeping it. My son would not take it off when he first tried it on. We are hiding it until Halloween. I can see him wearing this afterwards. He was very happy with it. I am concerned about him being able to wear this outside, its made tight elastic on the legs, so there is not much bundling up you can do under the legs. Quality is not top notch since i put my nail through the leg cover while helping him with it. Overall we are happy since my son loves it and he looks adorable wearing it.
B00001W0KA,4.0,My 3 year old loves his new Buzz costume!  It is exactly as pictured.  He is currently wearing size 4T, so I was concerned with the 4-6 sizing, thinking it might be way too big.  Our only issue is that the legs are a little too long.  This is no big deal at all because the thicker 'cuffs' that are on the shins in the picture are actually separate pieces that slide on over their legs.  It is very thin and very see-through, as are most costumes (especially white!).  I really can't imagine a child much bigger than a 5T getting into this costume unless they are built just like the boy in the picture.  (Long-limbed & skinny)  I'm glad I bought bigger than what I thought I needed.  As far as durability it's average.  It is stretchy, but I don't see it surviving this winter.  It will be worn a lot, and as costumes go, it's run of the mill cheap material.  That being said, he loves it and has already had it on 3 times today.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the costume.
B00001W0KA,4.0,Nice costume, runs very small. Listen to all the reviews... get one size up. I didnt read until I already placed order  : (
B00001W0KA,3.0,I purchased the 3T/4T costume for my son that just turned 3 and fits into 3T clothes. The costume was very small and I had to cut the purple cap to even get it onto his head.He looks cute in it and I really like it except for the fact that it is not sized to fit a 3 year old. If you do order this costume you need to order one size up.I have since ordered a second costume one size larger since my son loves it so much. It should be arriving today. Hopefully this one fits.
B00001W0KA,5.0,My son would wear this every day if he could.  He loves to dress up and looks so adorable in his little costume.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Speaking for my granddaughter, she LOVES the costume and wants to wear it all of the time.  This was all that she wanted for Christmas; actually ended up receiving two Buzz Lightyear costumes and shares the other with her friends.  It is a little big for her, but that's okay because she will grow into it.
B00001W0KA,4.0,My son loved his Buzz Lightyear costume and he was the hit of the neighborhood. I would caution others though to not let your child play in costume before the big day. My son played in his a few times and it started coming apart in the back seam. It held up well with a little bit of tape but did have to cut the "helmet" to get it over his head and it still got a snag in it but overall you couldn't tell.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Fit perfectly and was better than I expected. Durable and very authentic looking. My daughter was the best looking Buzz Lightyear around!
B00001W0KA,3.0,Have not resistence for childs
B00001W0KA,4.0,We got this costume for my son to wear to Disneyland. My daughter likes to dress up like her favorite princess, so he wanted to dress up, too. This costume is better quality than I had anticipated, based on some of the other reviews. It runs a little small, my son is five and the Child M (7-8) fits well over his clothes. The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants, and the costume can be worn without them. The arm panels, however, remain attached. The suit has an opening in the back, under the hood, for the child to get into it, and the opening has two Velcro dots to close it. This makes it a little bit awkward to get into, and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom. To use the bathroom, you have to take off the whole top of the costume, and then hold onto it so it doesn't touch a dirty bathroom floor (I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom). He absolutely LOVES the costume, and has worn it everywhere (except school) since he got it.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Ordered for my grandson to wear on beggars nite- he loved it- and i must say the cutest "Buzz" around!!!!  I also ordered the inflateable wings, too cute!!!
B00001W0KA,5.0,My son's been wearing this costume since the day he received it.  Quality is more than satisfactory for the price.  Im pleased that I purchased this instead of Disney store's costume which is almost double the price.
B00001W0KA,1.0,My son LOVED this and looked adorable in it, but it had a runner in the fabric within 20 minutes of putting it on.  He was indoors and hadn't being playing too rough in it.  Just normal kid stuff.  Bummer.  Also, he wears a 3t and we got the 3t-4t, which I thought he'd have room to grow into, but it fit like a glove.  I'd buy a size up if you do purchase this.
B00001W0KA,5.0,When my five year old granddaughter asked if I could get her a replacement Buzz costume because the first one fell apart after two years of hard use, I replied I would try to find one......she informed me I could go online.She was right.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Le compre este disfraz a mi hijo y le gusto bastante se ve muy original y es de muy buena calidad lo recomiendo 100%
B00001W0KA,5.0,Bought for my nephew, he loved it. Fit him perfect! :) He wears it around the house all the time yelling "Buzz Lightyear!!!"
B00001W0KA,5.0,I liked this costume.  It was very cute and fit my son perfectly.  It wasn't too hot to wear at school and I could add multiple layers of clothing underneath for outdoor trick or treating. Good buy.
B00001W0KA,5.0,I purchased the small size 4-6 and my 4 yr old son fit in it just fine. He looked so cute and i really enjoyed this costume and highly prefer it over one that comes with a poorly constructed plastic mask! He has hours of fun dressing up and i have plenty of pictures for my photo album!
B00001W0KA,4.0,The Buzz Lightyear Deluxe Costume is amazing. My three year old boy gets crazy when de puts in on. Really good. I recomend it
B00001W0KA,4.0,I got this for 3-year-old nephew. He loved it. The size actually ran a little bigger than I expected but fit well enough.  It is really cute and the best price I found for it.
B00001W0KA,5.0,my son is a small shortish 4 year of and this fits well and loves dressing up in this along with the blow up wings we bought
B00001W0KA,4.0,My son loved dressing up as Buzz for halloween......he still wants to put it on over and over and go 'to infinity and beyond'!!The only flaw is that it is NOT a warm costume to wear outdoors, the material is very light, so plan to purchase a size larger than you would expect to be able to dress underneath it
B00001W0KA,5.0,Fit well (runs a lil small but planned for that). Made my nephew very happy - he's 4 and there's room for him to grow into it.
B00001W0KA,5.0,My grandson loves it and the only thing missing was Andy's name, so we'll need to paint bottom of his shoe purple and write Andy  on it.
B00001W0KA,3.0,The product as expected is of cheap quality; however, it did not match the image since the custom in the image is of better quality than the one I received.The padding on the forearms and lower legs non existing, nor the black waist or joints for shoulders. It really seems like I receive a step down version from the one in the picture.My son, being 3, did not realized the differences and was very happy with it, that is why I gave this product and overall 3 star rating.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Purchased this costume (size 3T-4T) and it's a perfect fit for my very tall 2 year old son. I couldn't have asked for a better fit if we'd tried it on in a store first. I also bought the inflatable jet pack/wings. Can't wait to see him all dressed up on the big day!
B00001W0KA,5.0,I purchased this costume for my 6-year old grandson for Halloween 2011.  It arrived one week earlier than expected, and I was happy about this.  My grandson absolutely loved it!  I'm glad I ordered the larger size (Size 8) because it barely fit him. The material was durable and well made, I think.  He's worn it many times just to play in since Halloween.  I was happy with the purchase which was worth the dollars I spent.
B00001W0KA,5.0,my son loved it, and since I showed him, exploded in joy. He has three years. I can say that was transported to the cartoon
B00001W0KA,4.0,Son loves costume. Looks nice and looks/feels like decent quality. Only small issue(s) are built in cuffs make it hard for accessory gloves to put on.  Also the purple piece that goes under chin should be adjustable or more elastic, a little snug on chin/throat area. Other than that a very nice costume.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Great costume.  Looks so cute on, people told us how great he looked all night.  Does run small.  My son is 2 and we bought the 3T-4T and it fit him perfect.  You really should buy the wings because it completes the look.  Very happy with it.  My son loves it and want's to wear it all the time.  And he can because it holds up to it.
B00001W0KA,2.0,I have to give this costume a few stars because of course my almost 3 year old LOVES it...and all things Buzz Lightyear, and looks absolutely adorable in it.  However, he is in the 50% for height and weight and will be 3 in a few months and the 3T-4T costume fits him perfectly.  There's no way it would fit a bigger 3 year old or 4 year old for that matter.  The leg parts come separate (think leg warmers) and dont stay up very well, which seems wierd.  It's also all one piece and was impossible to get over my sons head without cutting the purple head piece.  Once it's on, if you try and velcro the back up you end up choking him and when he has to go to the bathroom, you have to take the whole thing off.  Definitely not very kid or parent friendly.
B00001W0KA,5.0,My son wore this costume for halloween last year and it was so stinkin' cute!! He wore it with his regular shoes and it you didn't even notice. He got so many complements from people who said &#34;that is the cutest little boy I have ever seen!&#34; We also ordered the costume accessory gloves but did not need them. They were a little too big and the costume looked great without them. My son also wore the blow up wings with it-- looked perfect!!
B00001W0KA,5.0,I really like this costume, my little boy looks great I would like that this icnludes the wings, but still is a very good costume.
B00001W0KA,4.0,Very nice costume, My 4th year old son, enjoy it. It fits well with the sizes that appears  on the web.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Love the costume.  My grandson looks so cute in it.  He wears a 3T and the XS 3T-4T fits perfectly.  I also bought the inflatable wings and they really looke good.  Cant' wait for Halloween!!
B00001W0KA,5.0,I was shopping for costumes for my son, and I was hoping to get a good quality product without physically touching the material, and to my surprise this costume was of very good quality material.....
B00001W0KA,4.0,My son was so cute wearing this outfit!!!! He loved it. My only issue with it is that I thought it was overpriced. It does run small like another reviewer said. My son wears a 5/6 but the 7/8 fit perfectly!
B00001W0KA,5.0,I got this costume for my grandson and he likes it. The Buzz Lightyear costume is durable even for 2.5 year olds. He likes the hood that goes over his head. The shipment was very well done and it arrived in perfect shape.
B00001W0KA,5.0,It was just like the buyer said it would be. I am really happy with my purchase and so my nephew.
B00001W0KA,5.0,My 3 year old LOVED his costume this year and I loved the price and the fact that it didn't look cheap. He got tons of feedback from fellow trick or treaters and the consensus was that the costume was great!
B00001W0KA,5.0,Fast shipping and exactly what we wanted! Our son was so excited to become a space ranger! He still wears it everyday.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Bought this costume for my 2 year old for Halloween this year. We tried it on as soon as it came in the mail, and he LOVES it! It's pretty good quality, although I'm not so sure it would hold up for a month before Halloween. It isn't flimsy see through material like the cheapo one at Walmart either. Overall, it's a great costume, and was worth the money.
B00001W0KA,4.0,My 2 year old son loved this costume.  The size runs a little small but the 3t-4t fit just fine.  He ran around pretending he was Buzz all day.  It has held up just fine.
B00001W0KA,1.0,Fell apart as soon as my son tried it on. Ripped at the seams all along the waist. My son is 2 years old and we ordered a 3-4T so it wasn't too small. Just very poorly made. Did not try this on my son until right before we were going trick or treating so we had to use safety pins to keep the costume together and keep it from falling apart. So disappointed!!
B00001W0KA,5.0,Everything perfect. Thanks, nice quality, excellent price, great deal!!! I recommend it 100%, the color and size are as I expected.
B00001W0KA,3.0,Great costume for 1 time use.  The jetpack straps broke right away and the costume ran rather small.  Otherwise, my 2 year old son loved it!
B00001W0KA,5.0,My 4 year old absolutely loved this.  I got the inflatable wings to go with it and he would go racing around the house yelling, "To infinity and beyond!!"
B00001W0KA,5.0,I bought this costume for my three year old and he absolutely loves it!  We just got it in the mail today and he wanted to put it on right away!  He would push the pretend buttons on the front of it and fly around the room.  This was the perfect costume for him and I'm so glad I got it!  HOWEVER, I did order the 3T-4T and we recieved the 4-6 so I was a little confused on why that happend BUT my son is tall for his age so honestly I'm happy I got this one, it fits him perfect!
B00001W0KA,5.0,Bought this for my 6 year old for Halloween. He really loved it and really felt like he was Buzz Lightyear.. He got A LOT of compliments!
B00001W0KA,5.0,Our three year old son has had so much fun with this costume.  He recieved it for his birthday and wore it as much and wherever we would allow.  It is true to size and very good quality for the price.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Very nice costume for the price! Fit nice and made well! I would receommend this costume if you are looking for a buzz lightyear costume for you toddler!
B00001W0KA,5.0,We got this costume for our son's 4th birthday to wear for his Buzz Lightyear party. He absolutely loved it. He didn't want to take it off.It is really good quality, I just wouldn't recommend putting it in the wash. Just spot clean if needed. It fit him perfect. He takes between a 3T in pants & 4T in shirts
B00001W0KA,5.0,I got this costume for my two year old and he was so cute in it.  They were unclear about sizes so it was big on him but I pinned it up and it worked out great.  I did get the inflatable wings to go with it which made it even better. The good thing about it being big is now he can wear it for dress up for a long while. :)
B00001W0KA,3.0,Woody's costume was much, much BETTER if~ you are deciding between the two?!!i bought both for my sons, and i was sad this one was not-as-cute! But you can buy the inflatable Buzz Lightyear wings, to make it look better;
B00001W0KA,4.0,Good costume.  Very detailed.  I like that the body is a foam so it stands up a little on its own.  You might not be able to tell from the picture, but there are shin-guard type pieces for the legs, and gauntlets on the sleeves.  Nice touch.  It is a little thin overall.  You'll definitely want to put something underneath if you're in a colder climate.  My only disappointment is that the back of the torso is entirely black.  It's ok for us because I bought the inflatable wings, but without the wings, I think it would look weird.
B00001W0KA,1.0,This costume was in a package that was previously opened, the paper inside had a tear. I decided to try to keep it and is too small for a child that fits in a 2T-3T. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Great product, my son loves it!It is difficult to put on and take of. Its hard to get over his head because you have to put their legs in first and then stretch it over their head.
B00001W0KA,4.0,My 2.5 year old got the 3-4 year suit. It's a little tight to begin with, so he fit in it just fine. The pants were a little longer, but with shoes, he fit it, no problem. (He is "average" height and weight, for a 2.5 year old, according to docs.)  If your child is "meaty" at all like mine is on top, I would suggest getting the larger size.After reading the other reviews about how flimsy this costume was, I didn't let my kiddo wear it until the actual day of Halloween. He ran around a lot but it didn't tear at all. I think it has a couple more good uses in it.If you are hoping to buy a costume that will last and will allow your child to play in it at home, I don't think this is the one. They have the $50 one that looks a lot more sturdier. But if it's just for this Halloween and maybe next year for the kiddo next door, then by all means, get this one!!!  For the price we paid ($35), I am very happy with the purchase and the pictures of him enjoying being the Heroic "Buzz" will last forever, even if the suit doesn't!
B00001W0KA,3.0,I ordered the size 3T-4T for my 3yr and 8 month old son.  When the product arrived and my son tried it on, he was bursting in it.  He's a regular sized 3-yr old, and a bit short for his age, so I didn't expect the costume to be tight on him but it was.  I had to cut the back of the purple hood that goes over the head because he couldn't get out of it after trying it on.  Also, the white pants are quite sheer, so undergarments need to be skin-colored or white as well.
B00001W0KA,5.0,This is one of the cutest costumes I've ever seen! My son loved being Buzz for Halloween and we got so many compliments while out in the neighborhood. The material is a little thin so we layered with a pair of white long johns and it worked great.
B00001W0KA,5.0,My son loved this costume- even after Halloween, he wants to wear it! - thanks - it was as promised!
B00001W0KA,5.0,I order this for my son who is 2 1/2, I order the 3T-4T and it fits perfectly. He looked super adorable in it. I also bought the buzz lightyear wings to go with this, it made the costume complete and real life like. We went trick-or-treating, and got so many comments on the costume. I really liked how the head piece was connected to the costume, my son was able to wear the whole night without trying to take it off.
B00001W0KA,5.0,This costume was very well made and it looks better then anything we found in the store loved it .
B00001W0KA,5.0,Our 2.5 year old was the star of the neighborhood carnival in this costume.  Costume did not rip or fall apart - he wore it twice for several hours each time.  Put black pants and a tee underneath.  We also got him the wings, which did not pop or otherwise lose air.  Really cute, well-made costume.  He had a blast and looked great!
B00001W0KA,4.0,I bought this costume for my 18 month old son and I got a small thinking it would fit ok since he is big(tall) for his age. When I received it in the mail we tried it on him and it was a little bit big but a lot better than most of the other buzz costumes we tried. After a few alterations it fit him pretty good and overall I am very happy with the costume!! It was perfect and now he can grow into it!!
B00001W0KA,3.0,This is a good costume, too bad it does not include the wings and gloves.  The Disney costume is better, but this quite acceptable.
B00001W0KA,5.0,My 4 year old grandson loved the costume!  We also bought the Buzz gun, gloves and wings. He dresses up nearly every day and this was a fun change from Spider-Man, Batman, Hulk, etc.The helmet for Buzz was too expensive!  But the costume was reasonable and it did the job!
B00001W0KA,5.0,my grandson loved this item.. plays with it everyday not just for Halloween.  great quality.  worth the money.  the gloves were great with it
B00001W0KA,5.0,My grandson wore this costume for Halloween. It was just as pictured and he had a blast wearing this along with tthe inflatable wings and helmet that we purchsed separately.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Great, durable, washable costume that my son absolutely loved.  Happy I could wash it for him to use after Halloween!
B00001W0KA,5.0,Great costume for the price.  My son has worn it a few times and has run around and no rips or tears of yet.
B00001W0KA,1.0,This costume was a piece of junk! It is NOT the deluxe version and fell apart after just a few hours of wear.  Buyer beware!!!!
B00001W0KA,4.0,The suit fit my big 3 1/2 year old perfect. Pants are a bit see through so long johns are needed but pretty good quality. I would have lines the chest piece to be a bit firmer, it is just cloth and caves in a little.
B00001W0KA,5.0,This was a super cute Buzz Lightyear costume ! I especially liked the slide on buzz boot, they stayed in place and added depth to the overall costume. The only thing I would recommend is we put on some white briefs over my son's diaper, so you wouldn't see his colored diapers, and he wore a white undershirt to provide some extra warmth.But compared to some similar Buzz costumes for sale, I was very happy I went with this one, it looked great and my  two year old couldn't help staring at himself in the mirror ! fun and he was very comfortable. I recommend adding the inflatable wings.
B00001W0KA,3.0,It was ok. The fabric felt very light/cheap. At the end of the day, it served its purpose for my three year. Everyone thought he was adorable dressed as Buzz!
B00001W0KA,5.0,We ordered it Thursday afternoon, used Prime 2 day shipping, and it arrived Friday afternoon! Tried it on my son right away (for his excitement), and it fits true-to-size. He is 4 yrs old, wears boy's size 5-6, and we ordered the Small.
B00001W0KA,2.0,For $40 I expect a much better made costume.  This is clearly designed as a one-time use for Halloween item (when we all know little boys love nothing more than playing dress-up all year long) and is poorly made.  I expect we'll go through several of these before my son grows out of his Buzz Lightyear phase.I also strongly recommend ordering a larger size than need be.  My 3 year old is too small for this 3-4 costume (it fits more like a 2T-3T than a 3T-4T and definitely doesn't fit like a 3-4).
B00001W0KA,3.0,the product is ok.the seller provides a good and efficient service.Thanks!
B00001W0KA,5.0,Read some negative reviews so I expected the worst and got the next size up.  My son turns 4 next month and purchased the 4-6 size and am glad I did.  It fits him perfect.  Even this is a little snug.  Glad I read reviews regarding it running on the small size.  Also purchased the inflatable rocket wing jet for $7.  Its perfect but do not overfill with air.  I keep it with just enough air that if it is bump against a pointed object, it just pushes the object in and not picture it.  This is key to it not breaking from a picture.  Also puchased mars/earth space helmet on ebay for $5.  Looks like the real thing and you could only buy this on ebay, not Amazon.
B00001W0KA,4.0,Well made and a fun addition to any child's dress-up collection.  It appears the costume will hold up well over a long period of time.
B00001W0KA,5.0,The suit looks great and was comfortable for my little guy to wear around. The quality was better than expected too, as it held up well through 5 wears and 2 washes.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Awesome costume. Bought it a little big so it would fit longer and it looks like it will.  My little man was super excited about wearing it for his Buzz themed b day party.
B00001W0KA,3.0,Tooooo small - not true to size. It was pretty cute but he couldn't wear it. The head piece is connected and was way too tight.
B00001W0KA,5.0,Good costume, good value.  The fit is a little snug, so you might want to order a size larger.  I'm aware it's supposed to be a little snug, but this was a bit more than I expected. Not bad enough to switch sizes. My son is thrilled with it, can't wait for Halloween!
B00001W0KA,5.0,as described very strong and looks great i am going to buy another one for my neice highly highly recommened good stuff
B00001W0KA,5.0,This item fit just as it is supposed to.  It is nice quality and my little grandson is very excited to get it.
B00001W0KA,4.0,i like it but the size comes biggeri purchased a size 4 but it looks like a size 6but it is fine
B00001W0KA,1.0,I ordered this costume for my Grand-son for Christmas.  We had Christmas a few days early and he was so very delighted to get this.  He adores costumes but I must say I was absolutely infuriated to see that the whole costume was coming apart at the seams after he only had it on for 2 hours!  I am very unhappy because it needs to be resewn on almost all seams.  With company inhouse, I was not able to even begin to sew it up for him.What a huge waste of money for such a cheaply made outfit!!!  I am very disappointed as he is also.  Do not order this item!!
B00001W0KA,4.0,This was a great Halloween Buzz costume.  We didn't see anyone else who had this type of Halloween costume in our area.  The only negatives were that the leg pieces were not sewn onto the costume, they were extra pieces you pulled onto your child's legs and they kept slipping down all evening.  That was very annoying for us and our three year old son.  Also, the size we bought was a 3/4T.  Our son had just turned three in October and the costume was pretty much too short in the legs for him.  We made some adjustments with the leg pieces and it looked fine.
B00001W0KA,5.0,I got this for my 3 year old nephew for Christmas.  I was a little concerned because the size seemed to run big.  After conversation with customer service, they allowed more time for return if needed.  Costumer service was a great help.  No return needed....he loved it!
B00001W0KA,3.0,This is a Halloween COSTUME, not meant to be worn over and over again for extended periods of time. Yes its flimsy material and sizes run small. I ordered a child's small size 4/6 and it fit my 3 year old, who's in a size 4T, perfectly, well, a little long, but we have room for heavy clothes underneath (I'm in WI and it may snow on Halloween...)Note: The "boots" are separate pieces that you put on over the legs of the jumpsuit. Might need to get out the safety pins to keep them up high enough to not be a tripping hazard. But these boots really make the costume!!! I also got the inflatable wings, SUPER CUTE together!!!My 3 year old wore it for about an hour today, to try on, then I had bribe him with ice cream to get it off! He loves it! Held together fine, should be fine for trick or treating.Lost 1 star for cost, as there's really not much to this costume other than strategically placed foam. You're paying Disney for the rights to be Buzz. Also lost 1 star for overall quality, pretty flimsy. Be nice to it and you'll be good to go!
B00001W0KA,5.0,My kids loved the deluxe Buzz and Woody costumes.  Both were very detailed and fit well.  The 'boots' (Woody) and 'leg cuffs' (Buzz) seem awkward and aren't practical if your child will be running around, but for the standard trick or treating they complete the look.  Just pull them off when they're ready to go play.
B00001W0KA,4.0,I bought this for my 3yr old nephew as a birthday present. He's going through the whole Buzz Lightyear phase.
B00001W0KA,4.0,Very pleased with this product! I was nervous about buying it online, for fear it may not be as good as it looks. It really looked great on and fiit so Perfect.  My only complaint was it snags really easily.
B00001W0KA,1.0,My 3 1/2 yr old son Loved the costume, so i know thats all that matters, But the quality of it 4 the price is very cheesy, & cheep, compared to a costume i bought my 2 yr old at old navy 4 half the price, that is awsome quality, & definetly should of been more, then was, material & quality,,way better than the buzz one,,,but over all, kids like,,,
B00001W0KA,5.0,My grandson was over the moon when he recieved this costume.  When I combined it with the gloves and wings (which were puchased by his parents) he is absolutely adorable.
B00001W0KA,1.0,I purchased the buzz light year costume and its accessories.  For the money I spent, I should've gotten something better.  The costume actually ripped as soon as I put it on my son. Very flimsy costume for the money I spent.  I went to the Disney store and bought a whole costume for less money and it was way cooler, it lit up.  The one I purchased here didn't. I gave the costume that I bought here to good will so hopefully someone will benefit from it, because I did not.
B00001W0KA,4.0,Good quality for the money spent. My son really likes it ...and he is a huge toy story fan. He will wear this until he out grows it.
B00001W0KA,3.0,It was okay. Very thin fabric. The seam ripped in the hood from taking it on and off. Our five-year old could not take the costume off by himself at school to go to the bathroom. A better on/off design would be nice.
B00001W0KA,5.0,This was the perfect costume for my 2yr old son.  Since we live in Florida, I thought that the costume sold by Disney was impractical.  I think it's made of some type of plastic. That's why I think this outfit fr Toysrus is so great.  It's a bodysuit made of cotton.  At first my son was hesitant to put it on.  Then again, he is in that stage where he wants to wear certain clothes that he picks out.  Once it was on, we brought him to the mirror and the smile and gasps on his face was priceless.  He was so amazed and kept saying "Buzz".  It made my husband's and my day perfect!
B00001W0KA,5.0,We got the custom really quick and it was just like in the photo.It was easy to wear and easy to remove, the fabric was soft so my boy did suffer from the heat.The only thing is that you have to see the height and weight of the kid and not the size, since i order a 4-6 for a 3 year old that was just right
B00001W0KA,5.0,my son loves to pretend in it and it has been durable for him! He still dresses up in the costume :-)
B00001W0KA,5.0,Great costume! Love that's it's light weight in case of warm weather. My 3 year old is super stoked about being Buzz!!
B00001W0KA,1.0,I bought the Buzz Light year costume for my son who loves it. I'm really disappointed with the store service. The product I got is not the same I oredered. They sent another cheaper model without the features selected. I paid for a "Deluxe" $[...] on special (originally $[...]) and they sent me a "classic" of [...]. Why they didn't make the mistake and sent me a more expensive and of better quality custome? Even my 3 year old son refused it. It is worth mentioning that the quality of material is not the best and does not resemble the photo. I'll never again order items related to this, or at least from that store. I feel cheated. It is the first time this situation happens to me. Too bad that this store represents only doubt and deception for me. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!
B00001W0KA,1.0,I bought this costume for my 3 year old boy for his birthday. First of all, re. The price it has very low quality and secondly, it is really hard to wear because it is one piece. I would not recommend this costume to anyone. It a one time only costume.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,Realmente el disfraz es de muy buena calidad, durable, y a mi hijo le encanto!  Y esta gente donde lo compre, me lo envi&oacute; a Mexico.  recomendable
B00001WRHJ,1.0,this produt is very bad in every aspectbad qualitybad sizeeven I did not recived a hat and no bandanna
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Our 4 year old really enjoyed this costume for Halloween!  He also wore it to his pre school haloween party.  &#34;Howdy Howdy Howdy!&#34;
B00001WRHJ,1.0,I bought this costume in a 3T/4T for my son's 3rd birthday and it just barely fit him. He would outgrow this in no time. I will give the fact that he is a bit tall for his age, but he is also a string bean. I would go the next size up.
B00001WRHJ,3.0,First of all, Amazon has best price for this costume! And GREAT customer service too!I ordered first costume at the beginning of October. Upon receiving it, I noticed a hole - some manuf. defect in the legs area. I mailed it back and asked to replace it. Few days later we'I received a new one.... again with the hole, but around neck area this time -  manufac. defect again... Returned and ordered another one, and didn't get it yet. I really hope it will be in good condition since my son is in love with this costume!It's very colorfull. I doubt it might be worn for more than 1 night because of the quality - it doesn't look durable at all. Quality contral is under big question...As for the sizing, I ordered size 3T-4T for my average 3 year old son (his weight is on the smaller side though). It's barely fits him and I really hope it will fit him in few weeks. But next size is too big for him (tried in the store locally).If you are thinking about ordering this costume, do it in advance and upon receiving it, closely inspect it for manuf. defects right the way!
B00001WRHJ,2.0,We ordered a multipiece costume as shown and described.  What we received was a one piece costume with the vest printed on the uni-suit and no gun holster.
B00001WRHJ,3.0,My son wore it for his birthday party-we had a Toy Story Costume party.  It tore within the first two hours.  He had fun and can still wear it but for the price, I would expect a little more durability
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My son wanted to be Woody for Halloween this year since last year he was Buzz.  I thought this looked to be the best costume out of the ones available on Amazon so I ordered it.  When it arrived I had only received the package with the hat and bandana. I have no idea what person would think that a Woody costume would only consist of the hat and bandana.  Someone was pretty sleepy at the fulfillment center I guess.  But I blame this on the vendor, not Amazon.  I contacted Amazon and they issued a refund and said to just reorder it.  I did, this time from a different vendor.  Unfortunately the price had gone up $15 too.  But at least this time we received all of the pieces for the costume!  It is good quality and fit my son perfectly.  It is a really cute costume.  And my husband bought a Buzz Lightyear costume for himself, so they will make quite a pair at the neighborhood Halloween party!
B00001WRHJ,4.0,It was a present for my nephew, he loved it because it was exactly he wanted. The hat a boots also are nice
B00001WRHJ,1.0,I received this costume within the specified time frame. Everything seemed intact, and knowing my children... I was not about to take everything out until right before Halloween. That's where my one star comes in,Tonight I took out the costume for my 2 year old. The &#34;fake boot&#34;/&#34;shoe covers&#34;... WERE MISSING PART OF THE BOOT ON ONE FOOT!!!!  REALLY??? AND I CAN'T RETURN????
B00001WRHJ,5.0,This is a great quality costume for a great price! I bought this for my 2 year old for this upcoming Halloween (he will be almost 3 then). I am very excited about him getting to wear it. It is very cute and good quality as well. It comes with the hat, but not boots. He has a pair of regular dark brown cowboy boots already that he will wear with it though and they go just fine!
B00001WRHJ,5.0,I really liked this costume.  It helped me alot in the theme of my sons birthday party..he said "this is an awesome costume".  I do recommended.  The only thing that moves alot are the boots, since they are not stable, they are just covered over ur shoes.  But I think he liked it alot and I was satisfied with it.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My grandson has been a costume lover for the past three years and I have ordered many from Amazon, His picture that his mother sent was adorable.  SO thumbs up
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My grandson is 5 and I gave him this for Christmas. It has hat, suit and &#34;boots&#34; and he put it all on right away and wore it home. This is not a high-quality outfit but for the price it should get him nicely through this phase.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Wonderul quality on this costume and very realistic to what woody looks like. My son got it for Halloween and wore it at least one a week for the next two years. He even wore it when it was too small so I can say it holds up well!!!
B00001WRHJ,3.0,This is a cute costume. My son loves it. I am not sure how well it will hold up. The hat, holster, and boots are foam. The holster is sewn to the side. The vest is also sewn on.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,This costume was soooo cute on my little boy! Size ran smaller than I expected. He's between a 3T/4T and it was pretty tight and short.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My 2 year old kid loved it! Cute & durable. We got this for Halloween, buy now he just likes to dress up as Woody.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,Great costume! Everyone gave lots of compliments! The costume has all the accessories with it...the hat, the boot shoe covers, bandana, etc. Great transaction too...would do business with this seller again. Thank you!
B00001WRHJ,5.0,I gave this comforter 4 stars because the colors are so vibrant. The quality is great and I will definitely order the matching sheet set.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,This costume was fabulous!!  Just what myson wanted to wear for Halloween!  We found serveral other Woody costumes for about the same cost that were made so much worse!!  This was a wonderful find!
B00001WRHJ,5.0,It was a great costume for my 3 yr old. If fit like it was supposed. Maybe a rope or string to keep the hat from falling off would make it the best choice ever!
B00001WRHJ,4.0,I bought this for my son a week before Halloween, I thought it was a bit overpriced but since I procrastinated I had no choice. The fit was perfect, but keep in mind he is two years old. He definetely loved it!!! He wore it for halloween and a couple of days after, I did not wash it because I was afraid the seams would come apart. Overall my son loved it & he had a great time trick or treating in it & that's what really mattered.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Amazon had a great selection of Halloween costumes-even the one my grandson wanted-price was competitive and shipment was fast.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Really enjoy this product my son love it. Is nice to know that you can go in to amazon at any time of year for items like this.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,This is a great costume, my son had a blast this halloween wearing this, it's of good quality, however i might add that its a bit small, my son is almost 3 yrs old and I had to get the 7yo size, it was long on the arms and legs buy the body fit him perfect. He's probably going to wear it again when we visit Disneyland next year and on his birthday which will be Toy Story themed. So I had to get something that would last more than one day and this will definitely do the job.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My son loves this costume.  We got the 3t-4t one and it just barely fits him.  He is 3 just last month and average size.  I am not sure how long it will last, but it was definately worth the price.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My sons comment: I love this costume and I will wear it forever even when am old. I love it and wish never to sell it. Its perfect for Halloween and stuff.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Costume too cute. My one problem with it is that the boots do not fasten to whatever shoes your child wears. The boots move up when my little one went trick or treating and eventually you'll need to re-adjust them frequently. Other than that little flaw the costume is wonderful. My little guys loves it. :)
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Brand new in package just like in the store but for a much better price. My son has been having so much for with this costume.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My son is almost 4 and LOVED this costume for Halloween.  The boot covers were a little goofy, so he wore his own cowboy boots.  He was absolutely adorable.  It's now almost Thanksgiving, and he still wants to put on his "Cowboy Outfit" when he gets home from school.  Definitely buy if your son wants to be Woody!
B00001WRHJ,4.0,It's a one-piece, slip the whole thing on arrangement that may seem cheesy to the adult eye but to a kid - it's just like Woody's. One problem is the hat could only fit an infant (you can tell if you look at the picture)so you will need a comboy hat from somewhere else, and the other is the boots don't always stay in place but they do for the most part and over-all it's a winner. The larger 4-6 fit my tall/slim size 5 boy, and it had more room in the middle, the boots just covered his size 12 shoe.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Worth the price , my son love it.Great valueI think it is worth the money and it's ok quality
B00001WRHJ,5.0,This was such a big hit with my 3 yr old grandson. For the price you are getting a lot of product for play. Like others stated  the size does run small, so I am glad I went with the S(4-6) instead of the Toddler size. He looked so cute in it. I am sure he will get a lot of use out of this. Product arrived very quickly.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My 3 year old loved being woody this year. He doesn't like wearing things over his face so this worked perfectly. I highly recommend this to anyone with a child that doesn't like masks or feeling restricted by clothing. Well made and you save big buying on Amazon as normal.
B00001WRHJ,1.0,Right out of the package I noticed on the left side of the collar that the stitching was not complete and the collar was coming apart. The Velcro on the back was also barely hanging on.  The hat was all flattened and too shallow to stay on my sons head.  He fits into 2T clothing and this 3T-4T costume barely fit him, so I would say it runs quite small.  We may get through Halloween with it still intact, but probably not much longer than that.  This is a Disney Pixar made costume, so I guess I expected a little better quality and durability, especially for the $25 price tag.  Quite disappointed.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Bought this for my almost 3 year old, he was adorable! The size was perfect and the quality was to be expected for a Halloween costume. He had worn it multiple times and it hasn't ripped.Only negative would be the hat falls off easily, as there is no string to hold it in place.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,It was a perfect custome for my 3 year old kid.The hat ws pretty fine, altough the fabric is quite ordinary. It is good just for a single use
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My son is only 26months but 34lbs and this 3t/4t fil perfectly. We had to trim the pants but ohterwise very cute. I did expect the costume to have rubber holster and badge. It is foam but still cut and the same with the hat. The boots are foam also and only cover regular shoes. The outfit does look pretty cut on regardless and we were satisfied with our purchase.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My Son loves it! The Hat was a bit misshaped from shipping but my son doesn't care! It's been hard to not let him wear it 24/7! I don't see the boots lasting much longer than Halloween since my son is already stretched and ripped them.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,LOVED THE COSTUME!! Super CUTE, and nice~ colors!the hat it comes with was a GREAT added accessory that comes with ~ the costume and bandana too!! The only~ downside was the hat didn't fit properly,it was not-deep-enough to fit-down-into my sons little head. I will poke-a-hole on BOTH sides of the hat and pull a brown~shoe string through them, so he can wear the hat some-what like~ a backpack if it keeps falling off !
B00001WRHJ,4.0,Very well made.I have a 5 year old son who had 2 parties before Trick or treat night& it was still in 1 pcIs a bit small though. It said size 6-7 ...he's in a 6 & this fit just right without warm outer wear. Would have been too small with coat etc.Would buy again if the opp arose
B00001WRHJ,1.0,I do not recommend this product, the fabric arrived torned ... Bad quality of the favric, my son should use only one time ....
B00001WRHJ,1.0,this woody costume is horrible!! very cheap looking and it look nothing like the one from disney!!i cant believe how badly made it was..it was ripped on the side of one of the legs andthe hat did not even fit!!!i would love to rate this less than one star
B00001WRHJ,4.0,This costume is like most others these days, so I didn't buy it with high expectations.  It fits my son just fine & he loves it.  The hat, holster, & boot covers are foam.  The hat definitely leaves something to be desired.  But on the whole it is fun for him & that was my biggest concern.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,This is a quality product! My son wears a 2T , and it fit him very well....so I would say it runs a bit small. However, it was easy tout on and off a toddler! He also LOVED the boot covers and they were fine to walk in. I would strongly recommend this product, not &#34;cheaply&#34; made at all!
B00001WRHJ,5.0,He insists we call him Woody when he wears it!The only thing I would warn about is that the size is on the small side.  My son is 4 and wears a 4T and this costume won't last him more than a year.  If he wears it without any other clothing under it, it'll fit better longer but he usually slips it on over whatever he's wearing.  The &#34;boots&#34; shift and don't stay over his feet but he doesn't know any better.  It's a great costume and I would definitely recommend it.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My 3 year son loved this costume and it was of better quality then the ones you buy at the store!  It also came with the boots that you slip over their shoes and a sturdy hat.  You don't have to buy anything extra which was great.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My son LOVED his Woody Costume.  This one was high quality, easy to get on and fun to wear!  There was great attention to detail in making it just like the Woody doll!!  Definitely worth the money!! - Lori
B00001WRHJ,3.0,The costume is not top quality but I didnt pay top price. You get what you pay for. My son &#9829;&#9829;s it and is soo excited for Halloween. I will say another hat boots and badge are a good idea for accessories.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My twin nephews loved it and put the costumes right on.  They just turned 5 and they fit perfectly!Good quality - I had the same costume for my son when he was younger and it lasted a long time!
B00001WRHJ,4.0,i loved the costume it was exactly what i was expecting i guess it just ran a bit smaller so it didnt fit my 3 yr old
B00001WRHJ,4.0,I ordered a 3T-4T for my 2 year old and it fits him just right.  He is in the 50th percentile which tells me this probably runs a little small, but as there were not 2T sizes available, it worked out perfectly for us.  My son loves dressing up in his Woody costume with it's boots, hat, and holster.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,OMG this costume was perfect! It was exactly as the description described. Perfect fit my son. He loved it so much he did not want to take it off.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,I purchased this costume for my 3 1/2 y/o son and he LOVES it!  The materials are not very durable, but will last until he outgrows it.  I love the fact that this costume had all the accessories; however, the hat does not stay on his head very well and I may have to improvise with a strap or purchase a better fitting hat before he wears it on Halloween.I read many reviews before I purchased this costume, and there were some concerns about the costume being too small.  My son is small for his age (37" tall, 30 lbs.) and this costume fits him PERFECTLY (besides the hat).  So if you are ordering for Halloween, I would advise doing so early so your child can try the costume on, or consider buying the size 4-6 and adjusting if needed.All in all, a great costume for the price and my son loves it and looks adorable in it (which matters most to me)!
B00001WRHJ,5.0,this is a very durable costume. It is everything that the description said it was. my child loves it and cant wait for halloween to be woody from toy story....we also got our order very quickly... we will be ordering from this seller again in the future...
B00001WRHJ,4.0,I must say that I was actually impressed by this outfit. I had read a lot of reviews saying that it was too small for their children but my child is actually tall for his age and he is 3 years old and this fit him perfect the hat and the boot covers are adorable. I won't give it a 5 star because I think it could have been sewn a little bit better as the stitching seemed to come out on the collar I was able to tighten it myself overall very cute outfit for the price you pay and for a one day event!
B00001WRHJ,4.0,I bought this for my average size 3 year old for Halloween since Woody is his favorite thing in the world right now.  I'm so glad I bought up a size.  He wears 3T clothes comfortably but bought this outfit in the S(4-6).  The 3T-4T would have been too snug I believe.  Shipping was on time and everything was packaged neatly.  Other people think the hat will be a problem but it fits perfect on my son so I won't have to do any adjusting.  The boot covers are pretty big for him so I may have to pin those to the legs.  He was super excited to try it on and is excited to wear it again for his numerous Halloween gatherings.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,I ordered this costume for my 3 year old son (He is big for his age so I ordered size 4-6) I planned it so it would be here before all the costume parties we will be attending. We received the shipment and the whole house was excited because my son has been anticipating this costume for a while! We already knew it would be cheapy polyester material, so that was not a disappointment (I mean it's only $24), but the costume sent to me was a size 7-8! I emailed the company (Costume Hub) to tell them, also explaining we needed it for the coming weekend (Oct 23rd) and they took a few days before they sent an email saying they would send a replacement one. Well the correct costume did not come until today (Monday Oct 25th) but I just used the too large costume for this weekend, as we needed it and the correct size did not arrive until too late.I do appreciate Costume Hub sending a new one, although it didn't reach us quite in time. But they did try, costumer service was excellent, and at least the costume was too big and not too small. It still worked for this last weekend. The new one will fit much better though! Thank you Costume Hub for correcting the mistake!
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My son loved it but i wish there was a string or something attached to the hat that would help hold it on or wouldn't let it completely fall off of him and the boots that slide over the shoes were okay but i found myself asjusting them more often. The things kids don't care about but what help the parents out haha
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My son was woody while my oldest daughter was jease and my youngest daughter was buz, all of which I got from amazon. The Woody costume was exactly as described, great quality, fast shipment and just down right cute! I did find size wad exactly as measurements stated. It was cool for Halloween so I put the costume over long thin pants and shirt, with that, the costume was snug, but not too small. So, make adjustments accordingly and be certain of size. Very happy with the costume, outstanding!!!!
B00001WRHJ,4.0,This costume is adorable.  My child loves it.  He puts it on all the time and it's not even Halloween yet.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,This costume delivered what it promised. Compared to different "woody" costumes we saw on other children this costume had foam boots that covered the child's shoes and a foam gun holster. Some other costumes just had the shoes and holster painted on the costume material. I'd recommend it to others.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My son wouldn't wear it because he can be a stick in the mud. However, the costume is very cute, came within e boot covers, holster, bandana, hat, and one piece costume. I only wish it ran a little bigger so he could wear it in a few weeks or months if he ever lightens up and enjoys dressing up in costumes.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,The costume fit my son perfectly.  Great costume for a great price.  It came with everything as advertised.  We were extremely happy with it.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Very well made and had a lot of compliments on this costume! For the price it was well worth it!
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My four-year-old grandson was very excited receiving the Woody custom, he really enjoys it.  I thinkthat is not the best quality but for  the halloween's day it's more than enough.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,I was impressed with this costume for the price. Its February, and my 3 year old is still wearing it weekly. He loves his Woody, and it has held up. He doesn't usually wear the boots, just because they tend to fall off. But they did the job Halloween night. He steps on the hat sometimes, but it reshapes back to normal. I am very surprised that its so durable haha.. I'm just dreading the day he grows out of it...
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Fully satisfied!  My son looked perfect and enjoyed being Rudy!Fits a little tight though!!I encourage anyone to buy it
B00001WRHJ,4.0,My three year grandson like it and use it at all parties. I guess it lack of instruction about washing and cleannig. I recommend it.
B00001WRHJ,3.0,My son wore this costume at Halloween and his twin brother chose Buzz.  Very cute.  But the fabric is pretty gross polyester.  The boots are polyester and foam.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,We got it for my 4 yr old son, he loves woody and buzz! This costime is pretty nice! Both of my kids loved it! The quiality is quite good, and it fits good, the hat is nice to.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,Great product. At first I thought it was a little on the pricey side, but ut was completely worth every penny. My son wears it all the time and it has held up great in the wash.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My son love it!!! He was so excited when he saw it. He did not want to take it off!
B00001WRHJ,5.0,My wife put off buying our 3 year old Grandson a woody costume at the usual places like  the big  W, T, K & T R us. This forces me into solving this nightmare. I found it here at the same price but because I needed overnighted I actually paid more for shipping than the costume itself.The product arrived as expected but what I did not expect was the quality. It was remarkable how much better quality the costume had, especially the hat. The hat was much softer than the box store brand. With the upgrade in the quality and the fast service, I think that even with the shipping charges I got a good deal!  Most of all, my grandson was happy and that was what counted!!!
B00001WRHJ,1.0,Have they lost their minds??!! Over 100$ for a costume!! Amazon, you are an idiot. This is an inexpensive costume. It better include a meeting with Tom Hanks for that price.
B00001WRHJ,4.0,A lot of fun for my kids, reminding them the beautiful story and the affectioned character.It also arrived very fast, I ordered two weeks before Halloween and it arrived in Italy one week earlier, great delivering!The quality of the costume is fine. The only thing doesn't work perfectly is the hat: i had to add a string to hold it on the head..
B00001WRHJ,4.0,This was a cute costume.  Everyone knew who my son was supposed to be.  We tied a string to keep the hat on (apparently it kept coming off at school) and the boots wouldn't stay over his shoes.  But it held up as long as it needed to.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,This was a great costume. I would definitely recommend if your son is into Toy story.  Caution it is very thin, so make sure to buy a bigger size so you can layer clothes, if you live in colder climates
B00001WRHJ,4.0,my boy is almost 4yrs old and size chils s fits perfectly even with room to grow.boot covers are awesome! he loved them!.would definetly recommend this... for 10 bucks it is really great!
B00001WRHJ,5.0,I purchased this costume for my 4 year old grandson and it's for Christmas so he hasn't worn it yet but he has some other different ones and I know the fabric this one is made of is great for kids as they can move easily without getting hot, it's easy to wash and dries fast, too. It comes with all the Woody "items" and I'm sure he's going to love it !
B00001WRHJ,4.0,So, lessons learned (I hope) for next Halloween to make up my mind a little earlier about the costume.  Second week of October I was looking for the Woddy costume at the Disney store and it was great, very nicely made, but they didn't have my son's size any more, not even available for them to order it.  So I went online and found this one.  It is ok, but not great.  Basically all one piece and looks kind of cheapy.  On the plus side the fabric is comfortable (soft) and not overly hot if you live in a warmer climate.  The boots are a joke, you're better off getting your own or if your child has brown shoes it works too.  My 2 year old loved it and wanted it to wear it all the time, so for what it's worth I got from it what I wanted.  Surprisingly it did well for a long time with the washes.  Towards the end he started looking like a cowboy going through rough times but the costume held up to the washing machine better than I would have thought.
B00001WRHJ,5.0,I bought this since my boy said he wants to be woody for Haloween.The size is a perfect fit and he looks very handsome in it! Well worth the price I paid and would buy it again.FYI it includes shoe covers which might get in the way when he/she is walking, but it is cool to have these included.
B00002243H,4.0,...this would be a perfect bag. It wants for a zipper under the main flap for the primary compartment. In its existing state papers get wet in a rain storm.
B00002243H,4.0,I've been using this bag a little less than a month so far,I would have loved the interior been setup a little different but works great for what it is intended.Fabric seems pretty durable.Great price/value buy
B00002243H,5.0,There are others, but not as inexpensive nor with half the quality and durability of this briefcase. I've had 3 over the past 6 years, &amp; will soon buy another one. The failure point has always been the metal attachments that hold the shoulder straps in place; they only last a year or two, in my experience. The mesh cellphone pocket is nice &amp; roomy, too. It has room for several books (plural!), notebooks, and odds&amp;ends to my delight, with a couple better-designed large &amp; deep compartments that have velcro flaps. Everything about this case says it's roomy enough to carry what I've discovered I need to carry around, and durable enough to last. (And it makes a nicer statement, I think, than a leather oh-so-so briefcase!)
B00002243H,2.0,I was really disappointed when I received this. The color pictured, a rather muted brown, was what I was hoping for. Instead, this thing looks like someone took that dye and mixed a can of day-glo orange in with it. It's heinous. Maybe it was meant for contractors to be able to find it at the bottom of the ocean or in the event of a nuclear war or something, I don't know. The main color doesn't match the trim either.It's a shame too, because I really like the way the thing is made. It's sturdy and the material is heavy without being too stiff. It's comfortable to carry and the pocket layout is very intelligent and spacious. I would carry this thing for years if it was the color pictured.Overall, very disappointed. Would not recommend this, based on the color alone. I wouldn't have given it a second glance at a retail store, except maybe to confirm that the purchaser for that store had lost their mind.
B00002243H,4.0,Other than that, it is a well made, nice looking bag. I would rate 5 stars had I gotten a shoulder strap. Luckily, I was able to find one in my stash of old computer bags that will suffice. Otherwise it would be going back...
B00002243H,5.0,This is rugged and doesn't look out of place on a job site or at a professional meeting.  It's perfect for me as a contractor.  I can put my laptop in it and a couple pads, whatever.Top notch construction.
B00002243H,4.0,I am 100% satisfied, especially for $29. As an engineer in the industrial world (chemical plant, utility, infrastructure, etc.) I need to take papers, folded plans, tablet, food, folders, folding carpenter's rule, gloves, safety glasses, cell phone, and assortment of normal small stuff (pencils, pen, etc.) with me when I visit "field".  The field is not always clean nor are tables or chairs often available.  Leave the "nice" briefcase in office or car.The Bucket Boss case has three main compartments.  Two are covered by a single flap-over cover and one has zipper.  Plenty of practical pockets and compartments.  The zippered compartment has its own set of pockets and can hold folders/pads.  With the zipper shut, the case can be upside down and nothing can fall out.  Good quality zipper, snap buckles, and other hardware.  All works very well.  Very good design and construction, high-quality rugged fabric, heavy stitching and hems.  Also, the fabric is pliable and not stiff as one might expect at first sight.The only drawbacks are the non-adjustable shoulder strap and it is on the small side for some users.  Several standard pads and folders will fit in each compartment.  I do not carry a lap top in it, but I think the smaller ones will fit. For me, the size is perfect.The color is brownish green and has a good finish. Looks good for what it is.Almost perfect.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only due to non-adjustable strap, though it doesn't bother me.You cannot lose with this one.
B00002243H,4.0,For years I carried a Land's End Square Rigger, which at the time was a great canvas attache.Got away from those because I wanted something classier, in leather.After many years i realized that leather was heavy so went to get another one, but Land's End had changed and the reviews of the new bags turned me away.Wanted something lightweight with loads of pockets, accessible from the top, with a handle as well as shoulder straps, with a rear slip pocket and could be stuffed without breaking the zipper.Made a few mistakes along the way, and somehow came across this bag.I like it more than my old Land's End bags.There are two large pockets instead of the one, with access from the top for one and a flap cover for the other.The flap can be easily opened with one hand while on the shoulder.The organizational possibilities are outstanding due to the pocket arrangement and the number of them.It's lightweight, not overly large, and can be stuffed without worry.Can carry it by the handle without closing the flap cover.It's not canvas, but I like the material, which should show less wear and tear in the long run.Not crazy about the color, but can live with it.Marking it down 1 star because of it.Happy with the bag.
B00002243H,2.0,The main reason I bought this was because in the description it says it has elastic bands to hold blueprints. The one I received in the mail did not have any bands for holding blueprints so I returned it.
B00002243H,5.0,I bought this for my husband for his business and he loves it.  He doesnt use a computer at this time, so I dont know how it would work for that, but its nice for a guy to carry.  Totally affordable!
B00002243H,4.0,The product is sturdy and well constructed, but the handle being offset from the center makes for a clumsy carrying experience.  Other than that one flaw it is a fine product.
B00002243H,5.0,I like this briefcase better than any that I see anywhere. Some may think it is not the height of fashion, but I think it is really very nice looking. It is certainly the most functional and handy briefcase I have ever seen.
B00002243H,5.0,I bought this as a utilitarian carrying case for paper word and my computer. It seems to be well built and has a lot of storage. Great to put in a measuring tape, tablet, pens etc. It is nylon so it doesn't stand up well when it is set on the floor but for the money it was a good deal and serves my purposes
B00002243H,4.0,I have been pleased with my purchase of the Bucket Boss Briefcase. It is replacing a leather man-purse that was constantly falling apart.  The Bucket Boss is well constructed and is holding up well to heavy and rough working conditions.  Lots of pockets for folders, tools, and gadgets! Very utilitarian, wish there was a more stylish version and an inch or two wider would make this the perfect man-purse.
B00002243H,5.0,After seven months this case still looks like new and I drag it around with me every day, sitting it on the floor, behind the seat of my truck, where ever. No dirt on it at all; it doesn't seem to get dirty. I've flown with it a few times under the seat in front of me and it's easy to retrieve to get a snack, or book from it. Plenty of compartments, some zipped, some easily accessible w/o unzipping.  I keep my passport & checkbook in a zipped compartment that's the perfect size so I always know where they are.  Two other things I like: there is a mesh pocket that's perfect for holding my cell phone; and  there's a strap inside the front pocket with a slide hook to put key rings on so you don't have to hunt through stuff to find them--very handy when coming back in from a trip and you just want to get in your car and get home.  The only negative, and it's small, is that there isn't a see-through pocket to put the owner's business card in for quick identification.  I'm living without that fine.  A good case, a good price and it looks like it's going to last for a very long time. The color is fine, distinct but not too bright and not gaudy.
B00002243H,5.0,So far it's just what I was looking for as a carry on. I have a Kenneth Cole bag but doesn't feet well under the set of the plane. This looks lie it will be prefect. Love the colors. There's enough space. But some may expect or want more.
B00002243H,5.0,I am a civil engineer and purchased this bag to replace a worn-out fake leather bag.  I use it in the field to hold notes, clipboards, calculators, camera, gps, markers, etc.  I also used it as a pinewood derby tool kit when we went to the races and it worked great for that.It seems like it will last much longer than the cheap leatherette bag that I had, which failed at the zippers and a seam.  It is not as classy looking but it has a workman-like look to it that will fit in well here in Montana when working with contractors.  The zippers and seams on this bag seem very heavy duty.  Also, I don't mind the red bucketboss logo on the front - it is not that big and adds a little more color to the unit.Overall, a great value here at Amazon and it should serve you well for years.
B00002243H,5.0,This was purchased as one of my husband's 80th birthday presents, and he loves it; he works full-time as a social worker and needed a new and different briefcase. This suits him to a &#34;T&#34;!! The long strap is especially helpful as he can swing it over his head allowing his hands free to carry other items. I'll buy another Bucket Boss Briefcase as soon as needed. Thanks for a great product. (My husband says: &#34;Ditto&#34;)
B00002243H,5.0,I'm a contractor and this is well worth the money.  It keeps you organized and you look a lot more professional than just carrying a notepad.
B00002243H,5.0,I have one of these bags for my computer consulting and it carries a 17" laptop with no problems.  I also carry various computer repair tools (screwdrivers, nutdrivers, needle nose pliers, etc) and it works very well the plenty of pockets.  There's enough room for a full CD binder carrying case and other tools like multimeter and containers of small screws and parts.  It's tough, versatile and looks good.  I'm going to order another for travel so I don't have to unload my main bag to go on a plane.
B00002243H,5.0,Well constructed, lightweight case is perfect for contractors working out of their truck. The tool side is kind of silly, but I just use the other side to hold clipboards, invoices and other paperwork. My wife calls it my "man purse". Best briefcase I've used in 20 years.
B00002243H,4.0,I've had the BucketBoss Contractor's Briefcase, Model 06005, for only a few days, so this review can only serve up first impressions.  And, with only one significant, and one minor exception, my initial view is very favorable.  With luck, I'll remember to update this review after a few months use.The satchel appears to be well stitched together of durable canvas.  Its handsome but rugged appearance seems right for the task.  There's no inherent stiffness or padding, but my use includes carrying a couple of clipboards which resolves that issue.I have a feeling this case will hold up well for a number of years.  It's already very comfortable to carry and to use.Some reviewers have lamented the non-adjustable shoulder strap.  Since I won't use the shoulder strap often, it's a non-issue.  An aftermarket adjustable strap could be snapped into place easily.Several reviewers have commented negatively on the red and white oval BucketBoss name tag.  The name tag's shiny plastic texture and its brilliant red and white colors are way wrong.  Anyone who routinely carries a combination tool and document briefcase is most likely not trying to make a fashion statement, but this name tag just doesn't belong.Well, no problem.  It's attached by a single row of stitching around the edge.  I grasped an edge with needle nose pliers and carefully cut a stitch with a razor knife.  Then I was able to pull it away with fingers and continue slicing the stitches.  Took less time than you've spent reading this.  Looks just right without it.  A cloth logo in the proper colors would have worked well here, but it's perfectly fine without any logo.The one significant problem with the satchel is one that I saw clearly from the photos on Amazon's site and others, so it was no surprise.  I purchased anyway, intending to either live with it or to kludge a workaround.  That problem is that the "Business Side" and the "Tool Side" are reversed.The "Tool Side" features two rows of narrow stitched pockets intended for small hand tools.  Nicely done, but these tools need to be quickly accesible, and preferably with the satchel standing upright.  The "Tool Side" therefore could be better utilized under the flap.The "Business Side" is used for stowing file folders and documents which might benefit from a slightly greater bit of security.  The "Business Side" then would have been better placed in the zippered section.  To some this may seem a quibble.  Depends on your particular work situation, I suppose.  For me the reversal would have been far better.Still, I bought it, and I like it.  I looked around quite a bit and could find nothing else that fit the bill as well.
B00002243H,5.0,Tough, durable, and well made. Holds everything I hoped it would and a lot more. I'm not a contractor but this thing holds all the toys, magazines, and files I usually lug around
B00002243H,3.0,The briefcase isn't bad and it meets my needs.  I wish it had zippered pouches, though.  Reviews I read indicated that the exterior pouch didn't zip shut, but I needed a briefcase, and the price was good.  Having used it for awhile now, I've learned how to work around the fact that the outer pouch doesn't close (the flap laps over and clicks shut, that's all), but it's still frustrating.  I've had issues before with briefcases and bags I've purchased online, and I think in the future that I'll buy them from brick-and-mortar stores so I can examine them to see if they are exactly what I want.
B00002243H,5.0,Perfect for what I need.  I also use it as a briefcase.
B00002243H,3.0,I bought this to have a separate, rugged, but fairly roomy bag for my Scouting &#34;stuff&#34; (I'm an administrative commissioner). I like it for its looks and utility and storage, although I wish both main compartments were zippered to avoid paper spillage.My main complaint is that the shoulder strap has no adjusting cinch. You've got to be kidding! Nope, just one length. Like it or lump it. I lumping it, with the bag flopping against my body more than I'd like. Oh well.
B00002243H,5.0,My husband bought 2 of these for gifts, one for each of his bosses.  We wanted to keep the cost fairly low and was able to with this item.  The Bucket Boss was a great choice.  Both are used extensively.
B00002243H,2.0,it is not the original. Smaller, different material, colors not as rich, shoulder strap is and looks narrow and cheap. Workmanship is good.
B00002243H,5.0,This item fits my needs perfectly.  I have a place for my phone, keys, Pocket PC, GPS receiver, pens, notepads, food, water, tools, where do I stop!?!I truly recommend this for people in engineering or any technical field.  It even stands up to an accidental coffee spill!
B00002243H,2.0,I was disappointed in the look of the briefcase. It will not work for office use. If you really are a contractor it may be great.
B00002243H,5.0,No, I'm not a contractor. I work in a major trauma center working 24 hour shifts. My briefcase/messenger bag is my life-line when I'm at work.I found the Bucket Boss to meet all my needs. I carry tons of stuff with me to work. Books/Guides/Stethoscope/Folders/Files/Pens/Pencils/Multi-tools/Cell Phone/PDAIt's very functional and well-built.-----------ONE YEAR UPDATE-------------The case is still going strong! No rips, no tears. It has put up with bad weather, vomiting babies, and a nasty ex-wife!Currently, my case weighs 8lbs 10oz! Yes, it's full of stuff.---------THREE YEAR UPDATE-------------Wow, it's hard to believe that I've had this case for over 3 years now.The case has held up superbly. Yeah, it's a little dirty and scuffed up a bit but it's like an old friend. Always there.One of the inside key clips finally broke. I had a little LED light attached to it. In the key clips' defense I did yank a little too hard.I now carry a Netbook with me. The case swallows the Netbook with ease and keeps it protected.
B00002243H,5.0,I've had my "Bucket Boss contractor's briefcase" for about a week now.  I'm replacing an expensive leather satchel that is wearing out, and this seemed like a quick fix while I shopped around for another good (expensive) satchel for work.  Instead, I think I'll keep this 'Bucket Boss' as long as it holds up, which may be a LONG time based on how well it is made.  The briefcase is much roomier than it looked in the photos, it's light, and it appears to be very sturdy and well-made.  Mine cost $28 and it would have been a great deal at $50.  I especially like the fact that the flap does not have to be clipped shut to use the hand-carrying handle (unlike some "messenger bags.")  The "Bucket Boss contractor's briefcase" is a great satchel and a bargain at the price--highly recommended.
B00002243H,5.0,and I wasn't sure about the colors - but the price was right and the bag has ended up being better than could have been anticipated.  It's  used it as an everyday briefcase/messenger bag, replacing a back pack.  It's perfect.
B00002243H,5.0,Lightweight, yet tough enough to take a beating, (although if your laptop is in it, I wouldn't recommend it)Many-Many pockets to slide things into and the laptop compartment is excellent
B00002243H,3.0,the material is cheap,too thin,careful with a sharp point it will rip easily. For the price I was expecting durable canvas.
B00002243H,5.0,My girlfriend bought me this bag when I took on a new job.  The bag is constructed very well and one of the highest quality bags I have come across.  In addition, it has a ton of space for just about everything!  I love the latch on the front flap; makes for quick access to all the essentials.  I use this bag everyday and it has yet to fail me.  Will be using this for a long time.  Highly recommend!
B00002243H,2.0,Seems like decent quality but despite the listing stating there is "room" for a laptop, it is not a laptop bag and can't be used as one unless you don't give a hoot about protecting your laptop. There is no padding.
B00002243H,5.0,I wanted something sturdy, masculine, functional, and nice looking. Searched for weeks and finally found this.Bought this along with the Portfolio which fits into the briefcase. Both are very well constructed, and look like something a blue collar man can carry without looking out of place.Plenty of storage room. Mine has my portfolio, a 3 "D" cell flashlight, camera, lots of latex gloves, disinfectant wipes, and then many forms and cards. Could fit a ton of stuff in it. Many loops and pockets for tools. Would work well for a mechanic, contractor, or repair tech.Only downfall is the red Bucket Boss tab looks out of place for my job which is requires a more professional look. May have to remove or disguise.
B00002243H,5.0,I work(ed) as a project engineer traveling throughout the country, carrying this bag, for 2 years.  It survived over 200 flights per year, being dropped in the dirt at job sites, has been overstuffed with my laptop, power brick, 2" of file folders, 2 to 3 engineering books, cell phone, pda, mouse, a dozen CDs, checkbook, gloves, eyeglasses, safety glasses, half a dozen legal pads, two dozen pens and pencils, two drafting rulers, lan cable, power adapters, usb cables, usb 4-port hub, mini-multi-outlet, travel network hub, and more.  Sure it's jammed and wieghs a ton when it is that full, but the bag can hold it and hold up to it.  It is soft-sided, so when it isn't jam-packed full it 'feels like a much smaller bag'.It isn't as 'elegant' as some bags, but in my hands it outlasted my Samsonite rolling contractor bag, my Tumi toughbag, and any of several attempts at leather bags.  To me, elegant is being able to carry everything I need without the ultimate loss of elegance -- not having something, or having a bag that self-destructs while I am at a customer's site.The two features I find most helpful are:  1) The laptop compartment faces up, allowing you to pull your laptop out at airport security very conveniently while keeping the bag on your shoulder, and 2) all the exterior pockets are well secured with big zippers and compression straps, to make sure your stuff doesn't sprawl all over the floor when you do eventually accidentally drop it.For someone who is looking for a highly versatile, exceptionally durable laptop or document bag that happens to be availabe at a great price -- this is your bag.After 2 years of abusive service mine looks very rough, one of the metal clips that hold the shoulder strap did break but was easily replaced with a $1.99 caribiner, and one of the zippers is stubborn but functional.
B00002243H,1.0,The case arrived with the front clasp missing so I returned it.  I probably would have returned it without the defect, as it is much smaller than it appears online.
B00002243H,5.0,I've had my Contractor's Briefcase now for about 20 years. It's got some holes, and looks a little rough (character), but I still carry it every day out to see clients and when I have work to do. The tool section is a great feature. I keep a few simple things in there that often allow me to make some repairs without resorting to my big tool cases. I'm just recently thinking about buying a new case and I just cannot imagine anything with fewer features. More than likely I'll end up with another Contractor's Briefcase.
B00002243H,5.0,Bag is great for what I needed.  Has lots of pouches/compartments for all your paperwork and goodies at a reasonable price.
B00002243H,3.0,I purchased this for the same reason a lot of people purchased half tool bag / half briefcase.  The problem is that is is more like 3/8 tool bag and 3/8 briefcase.  The tool area is big enough if you don't carry a lot of tools, same with the briefcase for paperwork.  But if you need both in one bag without having to carry to much of either of them then this bag is good for you.  I haven't used it very much but the workmanship and materials look like they will stand up to a good beating.
B00002243H,4.0,I love the size of this bag!  It's not too big and I can carry a laptop when needed. Pockets are great too.  Excellent servien
B00002243H,5.0,I was looking for a flexible multi- purpose schelp bag that looks professional. Found it. Affordable, professional looking.  Meets my needs.
B00002243H,3.0,yah i love it for the first time but whe i got it, was a lot of bigger forme and im short man. lol.so i returned but it wa in good condition new.. i will love it to buy another briefcase from this seller but first i have to make sure about my preferences.
B00002243H,5.0,I've had mine for a few years now ... and it shows NO signs of wear, even though it goes back and forth to work with me all the time.  It holds my laptop, and has enough pockets to keep you organized.  What I love the most is how it keeps it shape!  Even after 2 years, it has held it shape and looks new.  Plus, I tend to overload bags -- this bag can handle it all.
B00002243H,4.0,This bag works well. A few other color options might be good. I like being able to have a decent size bag like this to carry books, pencils, electronics if needed, without looking like an elite executive with a fancy leather bag or a preppy college student with a small messenger bag. I wanted a durable, reliable, simple bag that gets the job done. I am pleased with this.
B00002243H,5.0,My husband, who's an HVAC installer (for over 17yrs) is very pleased with this case.  He's now organized for various sales calls, service issues and staffing issues.  The case is strong and holding up well.
B00002243H,5.0,This is an excellent case, and fits my needs perfectly.  It fits my 15.4" Lenovo Thinkpad T61 like a glove, and all of my essential tools and papers in the other side.  I wish I had known about it when I first bought my computer.  However, I do wish that it had padding in the laptop compartment.  Although the canvas is durable, it will not really protect against bumps and knocks.  I plan on getting a fitted sleeve for my laptop which I will then put inside the briefcase.
B00002243H,5.0,I've been carrying my Bucket Boss briefcase on a daily basic for two years now, and it still looks new. It may be designed for contractors, but there are plenty of features that make it perfect for computers geeks as well. There's room for a laptop, of course; a special pocket for a cell phone that lets you hear the phone ring, tons of pockets for pens, pencils, screwdrivers, pliers, a digital camera, books... whatever you need to carry. It's rugged, looks good in almost any setting, yet doesn't attract the attention of thieves like the typical laptop case or fancy briefcase. Highly recommended.
B00002243H,4.0,My folks had a big laugh - Christmas present for the &#34;boss&#34;  Guys wanted to know if the &#34;boss&#34; was bringing his own tools to work. Too funny.
B00002243H,5.0,I really like it. Lots of pockets to organize my things in a neat orderly fashion. No need to be on the job, works great as an everyday carry-all.
B00002243H,3.0,The long and short of it is this is a pretty good bag.  I have had problems finding similar products at reasonable prices, and this one fits the bill. If you used to own a bag that looked like this, be aware that it will not be identical to the old one- the fabric is now quite a bit lighter than the originals I have (still have), and it is "laminated" on the inside with a type of plastic to give strength.Whats Good:1.  pretty good capacity2.  Nice inside storage compartments similar to a tool palette.3.  Strap for carrying4.  Place for documents, or something other than tools.5.  Weight: Actual bag weighs very little.What I don't like:1.  Colors- Why are they stuck on this combination? Its kind of ugly, and it always was.2.  Material: The material these bags are made with has changed since the first few I have bought,  and they are now a lot lighter and thinner.3.  Tendency for small items to disappear in the crevices of the bag.4.  Bag loses its form when loaded with tools due to the lighter weight fabric.5.  Prone to "wear through" in places where pointed or heavy objects sit.
B00002243H,4.0,Many useful pockets.  Heavy canvas; not like other denim attaches that are advertized as canvas.  I only wish that it came in a little roomier size.  Great value for the price, though.
B00002243H,4.0,I really like this bag, i just wish it had an adjustable strap with a shoulder pad with some type of gripping material.  Glad I got this bag.
B00002243H,2.0,I didn't think I carried that much into work each day, but I had trouble putting more than a few small items and pieces of paperwork into this briefcase. It does not seal securely and I found that things (anything carried in the main pocket), would fall out without warning during normal use. Not fun to lose a cell phone or sunglasses! It's probably okay if you really only carry a few things back and forth, or have a set of screwdrivers and wrenches to carry around to jobsites, but most of the little pockets are so constrained that it was not useful for general use by me.It is rugged and it weared well for a couple of months, but I had to switch to something bigger and more secure in holding onto its contents. If the main flap went all the way to the bottom it would probably be much more secure -- the top flap barely overlaps the main pocket. Also, the central clasp makes the bag tend to fold in half around it. As a result you end up with a curved bag that looks funny and tends to warp pads of paper, instead of a straight bag more like a briefcase or messenger bag that keeps its contents safe.
B00002243H,2.0,I expected a lot more than I received. I didn't like the quality of the fabric, the manner in which the handle was attached to the case and generally the way it was made. It didn't seem to be of Bucket Boss's typical quality.
B00002243H,5.0,Great! Just as described and pictured. It is soft so may need to place a clipboard or something stiff to hold form, if needed.
B00002243H,4.0,Appears well made but does not appear to be a substitute for the old Lands End lighthouse attach&eacute; which was canvas and had those wonderful outside loops for an umbrella.
B00002243H,5.0,this thing just works and I love the counter culture attitude about it.  no it is not black, yes it works better then yours, so what is the problem ??
B00002243H,5.0,I was looking for a replacement for my Lands End briefcase [I've had three of those but I'll never go back]. One of my complaints about the last one I had was that it was navy blue and things like my black cell phone would get lost down in it [along with other things]. With only a few small but deep pockets inside, there wasn't a good place for the phone, and things tended to get very disorganized. I'm a clinical psychologist with 3 offices [and a home office] so I tend to carry around a lot of junk, including charts, other papers etc. and with the Bucket Boss I'm no longer always rooting around trying to find something that I tossed in there. In my search, I looked at other canvas bags that could take the beating of all the moving about that I need to do - the Lands End ..., the L.L. Bean case ... and one from Duluth Pack ... but I saw this one in the ... Tool Crib catalog for... and it kept intriguing me - in part because of the lighter color, which I thought would help with being able to find my "lost" things. At that price there seemed little to lose but boy, was I pleasantly surprised when I got it. The pictures and text do not do it justice. It has tons of pockets, places for pens, wallet, checkbook...you name it. I've used it for over a month now and I can't find anything I'd change in the design, nor any flaws in the construction. In fact, I love it so much that I'm going to order a "replacement" now, so that when I wear this one out I'll have one already. My only qualm in doing that is that it is so well made, it may never wear out, but I'm sure my heirs will be able to put it to good use long after I don't need it any longer.
B00002243H,4.0,I purchased it as a gift for my husband who is a general contractor and he loves it.  He rated it 4 of 5 stars.  Definitely worth the $$.
B00002243H,5.0,I had been shopping around for an over the shoulder strap day bag for some time but nothing seemed to suit my needs until I found this one. I am not a contractor but I find this bag perfect for my daily needs. It is less  expensive, more durable, and has ten times more pockets than the  competition. I especially like the outer straps for blueprints. Granted, I  don't carry any blueprints around but its great for newspapers and  magazines not to mention a wet umbrella that you may not want to put in the  bag. I highly recommend this bag.
B00002243H,2.0,My laptop is too big for it, also there is no padding for one like a laptop bag should have. I would like to see an improved version of this a bit bigger with the proper padding to protect the computer. Maybe a few extra tool pockets. I would happy to pay more for a better bag.
B00002243H,4.0,Bag is well made and looks great, though I think it could have been a little bigger. The reviews on the larger "Pro" bag turned me away from it, but I really like this bag.I work in a corporate office and I think it looks great with everything I'm wearing and it's different from the bags that everyone else carries.
B00002243H,5.0,Bought this over a year ago for son's high school & college classes. He is always on the go, with different classes each day/evening of the week. Everything fits well and he is better organized with this bag. It is treated poorly, tossed around in vehicle, thrown onto the floor, under desks and it has held up well. No noticeable tears, rips, and strap still holding up well. Great value, would def recommend.
B00002243H,5.0,This contractor's bag is going to be perfect for some folks and not perfect for others. It is well made and has some nice features. I like the way that it doesn't unzip everywhere and dump things out. The only negative I have is that it is a little small for my particular need and taste. That comes from a guy who really doesn't have a need for a lot of space. I would move up to the larger model if I were doing it again.As long as I manage the space, it works for me.
B00002243I,4.0,This bag is stuffed full of pockets.  Both sides of the bag have access to pockets.  One side has a thin, document-size pocket and 10 differently sized pockets. The 'Velcro' flap at the top flips up and there is a zipper  around three sides to allow the panel to open completely for easy access.  The main compartment is open, and there is only a thin document-size pocket  on the back.  My laptop fits inside, but the lack of padding makes me  nervous.  In front of the main compartment, there is the most useful bunch  of pockets--2 of similar size (one with a 'Velcro' flap) fit my Palm  perfectly, even in its rather bulky case.  The crowning touches on this bag  are the pockets on the side. The padded cell phone pocket is great for a  cell phone (or sunglasses), and the tape-measure size pocket is perfect for  my pager when I don't want to wear it.  Overall, this bag is great for work  and has more pockets that you'll know what to do with.  One drawback of  this bag, however, is the strap.  It is short and not really padded, so  carrying heavy weight (like a laptop) on my shoulder is difficult.  As a  briefcase, though, this bag works perfectly.  It is durable, functional,  and great value for the money.
B0000224VM,1.0,Back of hat does not read "make the nail bleed" as stated in the advertiment, but rather Dead on Tools. I was very disappointed.
B0000224VM,5.0,I love these hats and were nothing but. I get so many comments. Nobody seems to know what deathstick means. Is that a snowboard manufacturer? Is that a band? Every now and then somebody will say. Do you frame? I say no, but I am aware these guys make some of the best framing hammers on the planet. Best quality tools period. These hats are equally fine. I work out in them daily ride bikes, work in the yard ect. It takes a good year or two of constant abuse to wear one out. And when I say wear out I mean color faded, not ripped. The only one I damaged was because I hot dried it in dryer and it shrunk to small to wear. I now wash them in the sink w/ hot water and let air dry over night. When the black gets faded I buy a new one. Old one goes to goodwill in fine condition.
B0000224VM,3.0,this hat came and it is a good hat  but it is not the hat in the picture being advertise it is similar but the not the same i was disappointed that the hat that comes does not say deathstick it says dead on tools amazon needs to change the picture
B0000224VM,3.0,I like the hat, it looks good, and has a quality adjustment strap [not one of those cheap plastic straps we all hate], but.......Made in China?Look if "Dead On" want's to supply the American Worker with quality tools, I think it's wise to sell us "Amarican Made" hats and other products too.
B0000224VM,5.0,A nice ball cap, pretty good graphics. A good cap, at a nice price. If you like skulls, it's a decent hat.
B0000224VM,4.0,Let me start out by saying that I hate hats.  Last week I shaved my head  so I needed something to keep the sun off.  I bought myself a fitted Miami  Heat cap and this for my dad.  The heat hat was made out of some material  that doesn't breath so it made my head itch and peel.  I borrowed the hat a  gave my dad not 3 days earlier.  I love it.  It is cotton so it breathes  well, the plastic adjuster strip is of fairly good quality, but only has  one row of studs.  The brim is also fine; it takes alot to crease it.  Do  yourselves a favor, buy the Death Stick Skull and Crossbones Hat.
B0000224VM,1.0,Ok i bought the hammer, thought it was cool being pro-america and labelled "American to the bone."Then I got the hat and it's MADE IN CHINA. Thats a load of crap and Dead On Tools is a bunch of sellouts. If you want to support overseas market share increase and put Americans out of a job buy this product!
B00002251L,4.0,I am an ironworker and have been using a toobelt without suspenders. Decided to get this to relieve some pressure/weight from my hips. The 2 buckles are a bit of a pain to adjust. The shoulders pads are very stiff and prevent my from reaching overhead. This past week I pushed the shoulder pads to my back and was fine. I plan on using some oil to soften up the shoulder pads and hopefully they will be useable.
B00002251L,3.0,works fine, too bad the leather is stiff and heavyThere is nothing else I could find like it, and it will last several lifetimes
B00002251L,5.0,I wanted heavy duty rugged suspenders that were all leather with none of that stretchy elastic material. I also wanted them to have a nice appearance and not look like dedicated work suspenders. These were the only ones to fit that criteria for me. The brownish burgundy color is very rich and the chrome buckles and hardware look nice and function well. I had no problem adjusting these suspenders. The range is very accommodating from small to large. They can quickly and easily be attached and removed once the loop attachments are installed on your belt by using the clasps, for bathroom breaks and such. Four loop attachments are included (one kit). I actually bought these for casual wear so I removed the heavy shoulder pads. The process is easy. (1) unbuckle both front straps. (2) slide the horizontal chest strap down and off. (3) slide the shoulder pads off. (4) reinstall the chest strap and make up the buckles. Done. You could also slide them off the back by removing that round strap guide (thing) which is the way I did it because the chest strap was so tight, I did not think that it was made to slide. It has since loosened up some. In the picture the horizontal chest strap appears to be riveted on but on my pair you can slide it and adjust the height. It is tight and requires some force to move, so it does not flop around. I would have prefered a chest strap that attached with clamps, (clamps that would not scar the leather). Mine uses leather attachment loops. These could potentialy become loose as the leather stretches, to the point where the strap might fall down, but I could be wrong. They seem a little expensive. When you break them down into their seperate components, there is not a lot to them that you could not pick up at the local hardware store for a few bucks, but what are you going to do, make them yourself, c'mon. They were delivered fast right to my front door by Fed Ex, I think it was Fed Ex. They can be a little restricting but that is the nature of suspenders, I guess. I recently removed the chest strap which makes them less restricting and more comfortable. As they break in and soften I can foresee them becoming very comfortable. These are the first pair of suspenders that I have owned and I really like them. Everything I wrote is truthful to my experierce. Yours may be completely different. If it is, I'm sorry. Good luck.
B00002251L,5.0,Very well made item. I only needed them to complete a lumberjack costume for a Halloween party but was able to resell them quickly on an online auction website.
B00002251L,5.0,I am a commercial carpenter,so I need heavy duty equipment. These suspenders are absolutely the bomb! They are totally adjustable and comfortable. Heavy enough to last for years and years.By the way, They DO come with the leather loops to attatch to your tool belt, so no need to buy extras as I did.
B00002251L,5.0,Bought this for my husband's bags and he loves it! Helps a lot with his back and is of superior quality! Will continue to buy from this seller.
B00002251L,5.0,These are made with REAL leather.  Not pressed "cardboard" / "layered" leather.  The quality is undeniably impressive.  I wear them everyday to an office job.  The shoulder pad and chest strap are removable.  The buckles / metal hardware are heavy duty and I would expect them to outlive my children.  Note that theses suspenders come with 4 belt loop attachments.  You run your belt through the belt loop attachments, then clip the suspenders to the belt loop attachments.  Holding up just your pants, they can be a little jingly.  I wish Occidental made a pair of leather suspenders minus the clips.  :(  Their site is [...].  For whatever reason, when i was researching these months ago, I had trouble finding it....so there you are.
B00002251L,5.0,The leather suspenders work well. They hold up heavy loads. Suspenders come with belt loops. They are ready to go out of the package........
B00002251L,5.0,I was impressed when i pulled them from the box.  These suspenders are built very well.  I wear them with an occidental tool belt all day long and find them very comfortable.  Well worth your hard earned dough!
B00002251L,5.0,Worth buying! Every year I go threw about 2 sets of Home Depot or lowes suspenders. But these occidental leather suspenders are great. You have to work them in about a week or two.
B00002251L,5.0,If you are looking for heavy duty suspenders, look no further.  Great quality . Fast shipping.  The belt keeper also come with the suspenders.  No need to buy them separate.
B00002251L,3.0,I'm a shorter guy and to make this fit I had to make my own holes and cut the slack off the restThe ink bleeds onto your clothes , I'd rather have it not dyed then have that ruined quite a few shirts
B00002251L,5.0,Well made. Hope to get years of service from this. My main use in addition to holding up my trousers is to carry my gun belt with attached Glock 19.
B000022528,5.0,I've worn, and worn out, a lot of bags. They've all been leather - won't wear nylon bags - but nothing has stood up so heroically to the day-in/day-out work-site stresses like this set of bags. Logical placement  of tool pouches, supple leather, comfortable belt - for what more could you  ask? My only suggestion is a little more realism regarding sizing - I have  a 38&quot; waist and the Large, which they suggest should fit my size,  doesn't. The XL is perfect however; take home message: if in doubt don't  hesitate to order one size up. (Oh, and as to the suspenders, they're  absolutely fantastic, or would be if they'd fit a 6'3&quot; guy...One size  fits most in this instance...Come on, Occidental, it would only take  another inch or two of leather on those straps...)
B000022528,5.0,I have been using this tool pouch for over six months now, and it has been great. I do home remodeling--framing to finish work-- and need a pouch with some versitility. The belt is comfortable even on those long days, with out any slipping.  There is plenty of room for carrying all the basic tools and then some --I find myself periodically cleaning out my bags to reduce the weight.A couple of things I would change:-The knife holder is not really big enough for larger knives, like those from Stanley (knife doesn't seat fully in the holder) but I kind of like the way the knife stands up a little higher in my pouch.-The cavernous main pouches (big enough to hold a couple tubes of caulk or a 12V drill with your basic tools) on either side can swallow tools, sometimes leaving you to fish for that set of pliers.  A couple of additional loops on the inside of the main pockets for extra pliers or other tools would be nice.These bags will make you the envy of the site, if only because you are the one to ask because you always have the right tools and more fasteners than everyone else(e.g., hammer tacker in the front loop and 8 coils of roofing nails in the pouches without dropping any basic tools) .  Less trips the the truck mean more work done and more $$.
B000024QZJ,5.0,then, you urgently need this recording. Art Blakey is on the drums of course, Benny Golson on the sax, Lee Morgan on the trumpet, Bobby Timmons on the piano and Jimie Merrit on the bass. Even though it has  the same  personal as  Moanin' ,  Au club St Germain  has a different spirit.  This is LIVE recording. So the tunes are maybe not as `clean' as they could  be,  but wow... this guys can swing. Let's take a tune everybody knows...  Moanin' (fifth track of the first CD) : over 14 minutes of loud hard bop,  of crazyness and of good mood... you can feel the heat of the club and, with  some imagination, you can see some people dancing. All the major tunes of  The Jazz Messengers are there, and for Blakey's fans, listen to his  solo  on A Night In Tunisia.
B000026D6I,4.0,To be honest it was a little hard to plunk down the [money] I did for this, despite its high praise (then to find I could have picked it up for.. less..!  but I'm so glad I did.  The real selling point on this thing was its sheer music capacity...  I was really looking for something capable of holding GBs worth of songs, and this ended up being a great deal as far as that is concerned.  The negatives in other reviews about the short battery life are true...  the player is probably just a little inefficient so far as power consumption goes, just like CD walkmans were just 10 years ago when the started getting popular (I used to have a portable CD player which took 6 AA batteries and only played music for about an hour!  It ran out of juice before most CDs were even over!).  But keep in mind that the 2 AA batteries are essentially powering a small computer hard drive, so the Nomad isn't doing too bad, certainly not as bad as it could be.  I imagine in the years to come it will become even smaller and more efficient, with a capability for more activity during use (such as jogging), but for my purposes the Nomad works great.
B000026D6I,5.0,I think that most of the other reviews say it all.  I got this thing for xmas (thank my better half) and I had it just in time for my trip home.It as all the featuress that you would want. It's controls are easy to use and esay to find with out taking your eyes of the road.  The software is even easier to use, with simple select and transfer to and from the player.The only problem that I have is with the battery life.  I was unable to find a DC 12V adaptor that worked with the player so I ran outa juice 4 hours into the trip home (8 hour trip thru PA with bad tunes or none at all).  I guess that I should have remembed the second set of batteries.This thing rocks and I would buy it even if i knew I would get only about 4 hours of play on one set of batteries
B000026D6I,4.0,Great unit. The other reviews say it all in terms of portability and cool features. The only drawback so far (I've had mine 7 days) is the battery  life is still not good. Will probably get better with a few full  charge/dischange cycles but even then the mini HDD does seem to spin 100%  of the time. Some completing units (eg Compaq) have more memory and cache  music ahead of anticipated use. If you loose the power supply (yeah.. I  did!) make sure you source a 12v 1.25a charger with a +ve tip-plug. Less  than 1.25a simply won't work -- this isn't in the manual. Also, don't even  think about using standard AA batteries. The Ni-MH's supplied are the best.  Enjoy !
B000026D6I,3.0,...For a first to market multi-GIG player, it's a good attempt.I've had the unit for nearly 2 months and use it when I'm at home andnot on my computer.Overall, the Jukebox is a decent product.  ThePlayCenter software makes it easy to rip/transfer music to theJukebox.  The battery life is reasonable considering the hardwarethat's being supported...anywhere from 3-4 hours depending onfrequency of use and file bitrates.  The 5 minute anti-skip is prettysilly (although it works as advertised) considering that the Jukeboxweighs almost 3 pounds and contains a 6GB hard drive.  Personally, Idon't like jogging with hard drives in my pocket.  The Jukebox'snavigation system is fairly usable but not something my mother coulduse without some training.The absence of forward and rewindcapability has proven to be most annoying.  Perhaps this can berectified with a software update, allowing the user to hold down theSkip Next or Skip Previous buttons to perform these functions.  Also,the inability to compose playlists directly on the Jukebox is quiteirritating as well.  You must go back to the PlayCenter software tocompose and transfer your playlists.The first real problem thatI've discovered ... that the loudness ofthe audio is poor.  I've turned the volume to it's maximum and wasunable to really feel overwhelmed in any way.  I've also fiddled withthe EAX effects and discovered that this &quot;feature&quot; furtherzaps the audio's loudness and adds a noticeable artificial quality tothe sound.The second problem is the sheer slowness of theJukebox's operating system.  This is a serious problem because ALL ofthe Jukebox's functionality is digital - including the slow-to-respondvolume control.  I realize that the Jukebox is a computer, but it'sbeing pitched to consumers as a consumer electronic device and thusshould be as responsive.  Perhaps this problem is rooted in a slow CPUor perhaps it's because the operating system and the file indexes areon the hard drive.  Whatever the reason, this needs some seriouswork.As for accessories, I'd like to see a car audio kit with afixed FM channel transmitter + AC charger.  A simple mounting kitmight be a nice as well.  Also, a remote control with LCD would be awelcome accessory, assuming that the Jukebox can transmit as well asreceive infrared signals.I hope Creative is listening to (orreading) these reviews.  For a v1.0 product, the Jukebox is a goodshot.  Hopefully, they can release some software upgrades to correctsome of the problems I've listed.  And hopefully the next version ofthe Jukebox will correct the issues that software upgrades cannot.
B000026D6I,5.0,As a major music fan I've watched the advent of Mp3 technology with a keen interest. As we are all aware until now the storage capacity of the players available has been wholly inadequete for anything other than short term listening pleasure.In my job I do quite a bit of travel and spend a lot of hours in the office. The ability to tranport the favorite bits from my music collection with me is a Godsend. The 6 GB Nomad Jukebox was therfore a must-have product.I havn't been disappointed. The Playcentre 2 software makes ripping your cd's and transferring mp3 files a breeze, although it is annoying (but not surprising) that two-way transfer isn't possible.I find the player navigation really easy to use. I would suggest that some of the other reviewers havn't played around with their menus yet. Contrary to reports, there is a facility whereby the active queuelist can be randomly played. The stop key also acts as a pause button which is obviously useful if listening to audiobooks.The headphones look smart and produce a good sound. I would agree however that the EAX sound system is gimmicky and those with a keen ear may be disappointed.Despite my minor quibbles, I have to come back to the fact that on my system I currently have 1250 of my favorite songs with room for more. This sort of portability was a fantasy until this player came along.If you want your music on the move the positive points of the Nomad Jukebox more than outweigh the negatives. Nothing on the market at the moment can touch this product. Worth every cent!
B000026D6I,5.0,I have only had this for 10 days but the performance of this device is phenomenal.  It stores 6 GB of music with intuitive navigation of its  various screens and the 20 hours of preloaded music allow easy appreciation  of its  great features and a great chance to play with its bells and  whistles before I ripped my own music. Additional CD's ripped and  transferred to it sound just as great (ripped at 128 kb).  The Play Center  2 Software allows easy transfer from the CD or downloaded from the internet  and can be transferred to either your music Library on the Hard Drive, the  Jukebox, or some destination on MY Computer. The biggest challenge with  Play Center 2 is managing all those windows of track information. Ripping  and transferring to the Jukebox takes 10 -15 minutes per CD.It comes  with 2 sets of Nickel-Metal Hydride rechargable batteries, good-sounding  Creative back headphones, an AC Adapter-Charger and a USB Cable.  I like  the fact that you can also record by microphone or by jack from an external  analog source in wave format to be converted by computer into MP3 and  uploaded back to the Jukebox.Unlike some MP3 Players, the volume at the  maximum is more than sufficient.  I love the EAX effects that simulate  Concert Hall or other environments controlled by whatever percentage you  choose.  The ability to upgrade will allow support for the infrared slot  and other future music formats.On the downside, the weight is heavier  than that of a CD player and it is not suitable for jogging in spite of the  5 minute buffer.  A car kit would be nice but is not yet available. In  spite of these few drawbacks, I really love it and it easily beats the few  portable Jukeboxes before it.  With more than 150 CD's my biggest decision  is choosing which ones will fill it up.
B000026D6I,2.0,I recieved the Jukebox as a gift a while ago. I thought it would be a great way to store and carry my whole mp3 collection and I was very excited. Unfortunately, I found the software very user unfriendly, the portable itself almost impossible to operate and, worst of all, the worst power-guzzler I've ever seen in a device of its size.The software is easy to install, but to transfer MP3's you have to have full IDV3 tags on each track or it all gets dumped in the wrong folder or playlist, and that means laborious tagging that can take hours. The CDDB tracklistings are sometimes way off base, (it thought my Craig David was a Faith Hill CD or something like that), and when the software rips off CD's, it hardly compresses the files at all, averaging at around 12MB per song (!), which means you're not really using the available 6Gb to its fullest. The playlist/album sorting style is not very efficient, since you have to transfer files to the nomad before you can assign playlists, which means that more often than not you end up with alot of 'stray' albums, (i.e. an album with one or two songs on it). I finally got sick of it and just labelled all my individual songs as having one generic album name and had done with it.Controlling the Nomad itself is rather difficult. You can select playlists or albums and queue them in the general playlist, but the controls are sluggish and the sound is, frankly, near inaudible, even on full blast.Finally, there's the battery issue, which is really the worst of the Nomad's many faults. Creative offers four rechargeable batteries and a power cord for the unit but claims that it is designed to be compatible with other brands of batteries as well. UNFORTUNATELY, I decided to test that on a weekend trip, leaving the bulky DC converter home and deciding to buy batteries as needed. I bought a four pack of Duracell Ultras, and put them in. In HALF AN HOUR the Nomad shut down for lack of battery power. I checked the batteries and found that they still had half their power, but the Nomad refused to start up for more than a second. I bought regular Duracells, and guess what? The Nomad wouldn't even start! Normal batteries don't even have the juice to START the Nomad, let alone power it.I got this as a GIFT and I feel I've been cheated. DON'T waste your money on this one. Try Archon's Jukebox. I haven't tried it out, but it's surely a better deal than this.
B000026D6I,5.0,Most of the various complaints you read here in the reviews from this product were once true.  Yes, it couldn't FF or Rewind, No, you can't upload songs back onto your computer, No, it doesn't support any other software...  These have all been fixed with the most recent firmware upgrade at the product's website.  It can now FF and rewind, play Windows Media Audio files, you can upload back onto your computer, and several transfer speed reductions have been made.  Also, I heard from people before I bought it that you couldn't read the current battery life, which is  not true, you can see it in the EAX&gt; System Info folder.  What you are left with is a Discman sized device, though slightly heavier, which can actually hold 150 cd's worth of of music.  I've actually begun running out of music before I've even COME CLOSE to running out of space.  The quality is excellent, I've been using the headphones which were included and they seem very nice, too.  The batteries were said to be a problem, but actually carry it on the train every day and all I have to do is plug it in overnight.  So if you know anyone who could use the equivalent of an over-sized CD binder, and have 420 bucks to spend, make someone's Christmas happy.
B000026D6I,4.0,This mp3 player is the only one out there for me.  I bought it only looking at the space and making sure it could support my computer OS (macintosh).  As time went on I realized just how great this thing was!  Not something to be jogging with, but great for non-mobile use.  It's hooked into my sony receiver right now pumping out surround sound through my speakers.  All the extras will amaze you!  It has a great EQ with +13 db bass, support for a microphone, and room effects (even though I don't use them)There are a few problems with it and a few things that people claim are problems THAT ARE NOT.  Volume is not an issue.  All you need to do is get full size headphones and the volume is more than enough.  If you plug it into a reciever like me than it's way more than enough.  The only problems are a slow OS.  It takes a while for it to start up then will have problems with playing music doing other things on it like scrolling.  Only for the first 15 seconds of a song though.  The hard drive will spin down then back up again while playing every 20 minutes.  Not a major issue.  Otherwise this is the best mp3 player to buy, that is untill mp3 pro logic comes out (new generation of mp3) or untill another mp3 player comes out to match size.
B000026D6I,3.0,Cons: - Need to keep it plugged in pretty much all of the time. Rechargable batteries are very weak (you get a hint of this when they supply you with two sets in the box!) - After years of WinAmp, building playlists on the Nomad is a pain. Pros: - Lots of space - Small - Doesn't tie up your PC harddisk when doing other disk-intensive activities
B000026D6I,5.0,I got the nomad jukebox about two weeks ago and its the best thing ive ever bought it not only holds 6gb of regular music but it also hold data files like aplications so you can back up an entire(just about)Hard Drive which came in handy when my computer crashed i had all my files saved on the nomad and it saved me from lousing every thing i ever had. It saved me from complete lose of everything. The new firmware update allows you to bookmark everything(including E-books) It comes in handy when your listening to an E-book. The newest part of it is the new Savantium software which converts News,Sports,Music News, And Quotes of the day this can be very helpful for people on the go like me. It can also hook up to AOL,MSN,Outlook, and others. SO you can listen to your emails where ever and when ever you want. The Eax Support is awesome it can  make any one and i mean any one into an acoustic singer. From Rap, to rock to any other type and holds 1500 songs. What else could you ask for in an mp3 player It has it all sound ajustment,tons of storage(back up device to). Plays email and is upgradeable.And recordable featuresThis Is a must have for recording people, Music lovers and email.
B000026D6I,4.0,I've already posted an extensive review on the page for the silver Nomad (why they list these apart is mystery to me), so I won't repeat it all here, but I did have a tech tip for the very unhappy purchaser listed below who complained about the unit locking up.There is a tiny reset button on the underside of the unit.  Just push a straightened paper clip through it and the unit oughta start right up, with no loss of data.  I am shocked if customer support did not tell you to do this before doing all sorts of other stuff, so that doesn't bode too well.  Mine also locked up on the first day (and, strangely, never did again) and I noticed that there was no mention of the reset button in the instructions.
B000026D6I,5.0,It seems to be a very good product, but i don't understand why it only can be shipped in the U.S.A., because i am from Guatemala and i would like to buy it. Please send an answer.My E-Mail is Calincho33@hotmail.com.
B000026D6I,5.0,Before I begin, I need to clarify that the NOMAD Jukebox has *6GB* of Hard Drive space, not 3GB as the other two reviews have stated.This product  is, quite simply, amazing. 6GB of audio, Environmental Audio built in,  backlit LCD menu system, support for surround sound ouput, the list goes on  and on. Similar products sell for around $800, and most of them have around  4GB of Hard Drive space.This is the digital music player to own! It  blows all others out of the water.
B000026D6I,5.0,Although the controls are a little akward and annoying to use at times, this minor drawback is completely outweighed by the other features and overall quality of the Nomad.  I have the original 6 gig model, but last I checked, it's upgradable to 60 gigs, since it uses a standard laptop harddrive, which can be changed. I've found 6 gigs to be plenty for when I'm on the go, and use my Nomad primarily in my taxi, where I hook it's line output to the line input on my older Pioneer car stereo.  It's truly perfect for 12 hour shifts as a cab driver, and my passengers love it too. The sound is nothing short of awesome if you have good sounding mp3s, since it's sound hardware is basically a SoundBlaster Live. The firmware is upgradable too, so this player can adapt to new file formats as they're introduced in the future.In order to fully appriciate this player, you should already have a sizable mp3 library. Mine was up to about 120 gigs when I bought my Nomad Jukebox last year.  Realise, it will take you a while to get 6 gigs of mp3s into it with USB.  Once you fill it up though, it's a real pleasure to remove the songs you're tired of and add more new ones.The Playcenter 2 software that ships with the Nomad Jukebox is completely awful; so bad I nearly returned mine shortly after I bought it. There are much better programs for making mp3s which I of course already had.  Fortunatly, there is also other software available for the Nomad, so you don't have to use the wreched PlayCenter software at all. I've been using Notmad Explorer from Redchair Software for almost a year with my Nomad, and love it.  Notmad (for Windows) integrates into Windows Explorer and makes moving files to and from the Nomad Jukebox via USB as easy as copying them to another harddrive, and gives network support that as far as I could tell was absent in PlayCenter.  Notmad Explorer also lets you create and edit your playlists so you don't have to do it with the tiny bottons and screen on the player.  It also has the ability to edit the ID3 tags of the files on the Nomad Jukebox, a crucial feature that PlayCenter lacks.The most amazing feature of the Nomad Jukebox, which I rarely see mentioned, is not only is it a player, it's also a recorder, and an exceptional one at that. Using it's analog audio input, It makes recordings that put to shame anything I've EVER heard before. It records to 16-bit wave files at either 44k (CD quality) or 48k (slightly higher DAT quality). I've been using it to digitally record my vinyl and cassettes, and have also made amazing recordings of concerts and band jam sessions with it. The wave files I easily move to a PC with Notmad Explorer to edit and compress into mp3s. I've been making mp3s from analog sources with PCs since 1999, and the quality of the mp3s made from wave files recorded with the Nomad Jukebox are so good it's stunning. I've been collecting records since 1973, so this feature is really a dream come true. Oddly enough, it lacks an input level meter, but the recording level is adjustable, so with a little trial and error you can get it perfect.Another perk is that the Nomad Jukebox runs on 12 volts DC; perfect for using in a car. The included rechargable batteries are only good for about 3 hours, but they're standard AA batteries, so as better battery technology develops, this too can improve. I'm amazed how many people complain about this, as all things considered, three hours of playback is very good. Few laptops will play mp3s this long on thier batteries, and additional batteries for the Nomad are much cheaper than any laptop battery by a long shot.The EAX feature that's so hyped I've found to be a complete waste.  Why add cheezy echo delay effects to a player that without them sounds excellent?No, the Nomad Jukebox is not very suitable for active use (jogging, snowboarding, etc), but it's really not intended for that. I have found it to be perfect for bicycle riding around town, as long as the ride is under two hours. I also use it while riding the bus and walking. The supplied carrying case is pretty useless, but since the Nomad Jukebox is roughly the size of a portable CD player, it wasn't hard to find a nice suitable case for it with a strap and room for it's cables.The complaints about CDDB file naming issues really amuse me. It's a user-submitted database, of course it's riddled with errors. Am I the only person left that's not too lazy to type in my own ID3 tags? This is very easy to do with Winamp before uploading the files to the Nomad. One note about ID3 tags: use ID3v1, not ID3v2 if you care about continous play albums, otherwise you'll hear a pause in the music as the Nomad Jukebox changes tracks. This is because ID3v1 uses the mp3 file header, and ID3v2 appends itself to the end of the file, making the mp3 slightly larger, enough to cause a pause. The Nomad Jukebox is the ONLY player I've seen that will not insert a pause between files, but only if there are no ID3v2 tags. Those are easily removed with Winamp as well. I know some people prefer WMA to mp3, but personally I'm not impressed.In short, the Nomad Jukebox is a remarkably good portable audio component if used with third party software and accessories. It's much more than merely an mp3 player, and well worth every penny. Unlike other mp3 devices, it's fully upgradable, and should never really be obselete. I've nearly stopped burning CDs since I got it, since I can hook my Nomad Jukebox up to nearly any stereo or amplified speakers. I've yet to see a better way to take a large amount of music with you. Sure, the iPod is smaller, but it's features don't even compare to the Nomad Jukebox. Once you've made the jump to this harddrive based player, memory based ones seem laughably limited, and carrying CDs with you, even mp3-CDs, seems silly.
B000026D6I,3.0,We researched MP3 players extensively before purchasing the Jukebox. When it works, we love it! However, there have been some serious problems with it, and Creative's Customer Service has been distinctly lacking.Our first problem was with transferring to the player. We could only do this in small batches (less than a full CD) or they wouldn't make it to the player. And, we couldn't do anything else on our PC. We also tried this on different PCs and on Macs, but had the same problem.Our next problem was that the player locked up (stuck on preparing library screen). The only solution to this problem was to reformat the hard drive. This was a really bad situation, as I was traveling at the time, and therefore lost all the music I had brought with me.When we called Creative Labs about these problems, they were less than helpful. After much arguing and being put on hold (by calling the TOLL number!) they finally agreed to accept the unit back for &quot;testing&quot; as to why it had problems. They did send us a new player, but we haven't had it long enough to know if the problems will resurface.The bottom line is, while the concept is GREAT (when it's working, I love it!0 there are still quite a few bugs that need to be worked out. If you have patience, wait for the next generation of these players.
B000026D6I,4.0,Overall, I am very happy with my purchase of the Jukebox. However, there are a few minor annoyances which warrant improvement. Many have been voiced here, and I found them to be very true.Pros: Holds a ton of music, easy to use OS, sounds excellent, fast transfers, gets a lot of comments from &quot;The Jones'&quot;Cons: Headphones are too small/tight, carrying case won't carry headphones, load time when starting the device is long, battery life is short, mac software does not do all that win software does.It may be just me, but I would love for a way to be able to list artists under genres rather than just albums, and I haven't figured out how yet.If you want something that will hold a ton of music and sound great, this is the device for you. It won't be your jogging partner, but it will sound great in the car (find a car adapter at radio shack or wait for the official one). I reccomend a good pair of headphones with it, I purchased the Sony MDRCD580 Digital reference headphones for $80.
B000026D6I,5.0,this is a most outstanding product.  anyone considering a portable CD player should seriously consider this step ahead in digital music playback and recording...  Mobile DJ's:  This is an item you can't do without.  If you think you don't need it, then you don't understand what it can do...
B000026D6I,3.0,I bought this MP3 player during Fall of 2000 and expected to buy the car kit along with it, so I don't have to waste battery. Well it wasn't available anywhere. So I had to use battery, good thing they gave me 8 rechargeable batteries. I love it that it will hold all my MP3 and I don't have to make CDs anymore, but I despise the way it eats away your battery. A 2 hour battery life is not very good if you traveling a very long ways. I hope that they can come out with batteries that would not drain as quickly. Overall, if you can shell out $*** then this MP3 Player is the one to get, but be warned: IT WILL EAT YOUR BATTERIES.
B000026D6I,4.0,i have a 20 gig model. (it is a [LOT] of space) if i put everything i got on it, in mp3's i got it about half full. howeve, the software is a major headache. i've gone so far as to download a plugin for my musicmatch jukebox player to move files to the nomad. i try to use the included software, and the id3tag reader crashes on any tag with () anywhere for example "jessica simpson - irresistable (so so def remix)" a major headache. the player itself sounds good, but if your batteries are dead prepare for the biggest headache of all, my player when the batteries are removed, it loses the entire library! the space is still taken up in the player (no items displayed in library), and i have run disk clean up but now that doesn't seem to be an option in the eax menu (help me!) i like te player sound, the digital effects don't really impress me. however once in a while i'll turn on the club setting and put the player in my car with my kicker L7 and 2400 watt system, jus to anger the neighbors. if someone can help me find disk clean up again i'd be very appreciative.
B000026D6I,5.0,This is the best digital music player available and probably will be the best for some time now.  There is nothing else that can play MP3 files that holds six gigs of music except for the way overpriced HanGo Personal Jukebox.  This not only has six gigs of music storage, there are going to be codec updates in the future so you can play liquid audio, WMA and other file types.  Balls-on accurate playback with a 3-band equalizer make the sound easily customizable.  The screen even lets you navigate through your files very easily.  If you want an MP3 player, you would be a fool to get anything less!
B000026D6I,4.0,I bought this play with high hopes and most of them are met.  The unit plays well.  The battery life is a little weak, but Creative Labs is very thoughtful and includes a second set of batteries.  It recharges fast enough and I usually listen when it's plugged in anyhow.  Be carefull of using regular batteries, they will be drained within 2 hours!  On the good side, this does as expected, plays many hours of music, sounds great and is easy to navigate.The down side is:I would like to see bettter support through the webstie from Creative Labs.  This is a costly item, it would be great to have Web chat or something to get simple answersThe software is not the best.  When I try to rip Mp3's from a CD the first track is always messed up.  I have to rip the first track from the CD to the hard drive and then trasfer to the CD.  This is annoying because I am trying to save space on my hard drive..wma files are supposed to offer better sound quality at lower kb rates, so therefore smaller files so more can be stored on the Jukebox.  But, I can't seem to get the same quality when ripping from CD to .wma with the Play Center software included.  I get better .wma sound using Windows Media Player, but again that goes to the hard drive then to the Jukebox.i also can't figure out how to trasnfer from the Jukebox to a PC.  The Jukebox comes with a couple audio books that I would like to put onto PC and make room on the Nomad for more music.Overall the next version of the Jukebox should be great.  It needs a bigger drive, maybe 20 gig.  It also could use a tuner for FM signals to make it more of a complete product.  I would also love to see a digital out to plug into a good quality stereo.  I would say people should hold off buying until the next gen of players are on the market.  But, if you want something that holds 150 CD's now (600 if I could figure out how to get the higher quality .wma files on it), it's as good as it gets.
B000026D6I,5.0,First, an &quot;in a nutshell&quot; review:  If you have a lot of music, this is the player for you.  Easy to use, and great sound quality.  I'm satisfied!Now, the &quot;long version&quot;:  I had been researching MP3 players for a few weeks, trying to decide which would suit me best.  I have a large CD collection, and I download a lot of hard-to-find music from Napster, so I have a lot of music files, so I wanted a player with high capacity.  I finally settled on the Nomad Jukebox because of its 6 gigabyte storage capacity.The ripping software (Playcenter 2) is adequate, and you can rip CD's to the player as well as to your hard drive.  I found the software quite easy to use.I've read complaints about the sound quality of the headphones that came with the Jukebox, but I found them quite adequate.  The Jukebox does not come with a car kit (DC adaptor and cassette player insert), but worked fine with the car kit I had from a Discman and sounds great.Problems:  Not many that I have noticed, though I have noticed that the more files stored, the slower the boot-up time.  Other than that, no problems!I am completely satisfied with my Nomad Jukebox, and if you're looking for a high-capacity MP3 player, look no further.
B000026D6I,4.0,I'm chomping at the bit too. I want to carry around basically all of my music where ever I go -- in the car, on the train, when I'm stuck in the airport. I use my laptop to hold about 400 songs but the battery drain usually prevents from my full enjoyment. From all the reviews here a compilation of the major concerns:1 - battery life is only about 3-4 hours, the included rechargables are fickle2 - bulky compared with other MP3 players3 - not good for exercise b/c it uses a hard drive (moving parts) v. memory (non-moving parts) for storage4 - not loud enough5 - headphones are mediocre6 - instruction manuel is very poor7 - no car power adaptor availableGood things1 - storage capacity is about a large as you could want it2 - music transfer is quick and painlessIn the end, I can understand if you can't wait (I'm having trouble myself). But I am very eager to see the next version (possibly smaller, lith-ion batteries, car adaptor, voice recorder!) and those by other mfgs. It will be in Q1'01 and patience will likely be rewarded, expecially in price.
B000026D6I,4.0,When this item first came out, it was the best thing ever invented. I had it for about 8 months before I upgraded the hard drive to a 30gb. I took this thing everywhere with me (even to bed at night). It became an obsession. I purchased the car adapter kit from jukeboxaccessories.com so that I could take it along with me for long trips and listen to kiyosaki audio books.
B000026D6I,4.0,I BOUGHT A NOMAD JUKEBOX ABOUT A MONTH AGO, HAVING READ YOUR REVIEWS I AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT IT IS A BIT NOISY AND TAKES FOREVER TO START UP,WHICH CAN BE A LITTLE ANOYING WHILE DRIVING.THE JUKE BOX ,I HAVE IS THE TYPE WITH THE 6 GIGA MEM.I AM USING IT WITH THE NEW SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS XP.I ENCOUNTERED A MAJOR PROBLEM THREE WEEKS AGO, WHILE RIPPING A CD TO MP3,THE JUKEBOX WENT DEAD,THE LCD SCREEN WAS DEAD AND UPON RESTARTING THE JUKEBOX,I DISCOVERED THAT MY PREVIOUS MP3 DOWNLOADS  WERE ERASED.I WAS DISAPIONTED AND HAPPY.THE SAD PART WAS THAT I HAD TO DOWNLOAD EVERYTHING TO THE JUKEBOX FROM THE START.THE HAPPY PART WAS THE FACT THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING ONLY 6 GIGA,I NOW HAVE 12.7 GIGA TO STORE MY MUSIC IN.THERE ARE NO MORE PRELOADED FILES, I LOST SOME FUNCTIONS,AND EVERYTIME I START THE JUKEBOX IT OPENS THE SAME PLAYLIST, OF A COUPLE OF ALBUMS, WITHOUT STORING THE LAST PLAYLIST.I HAVE A COUPLE OF PICS TO SHOW THE CURRENT MEMORY STATIS OF MY JUKEBOX BUT UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT KNOW HOW ATTACH THEM TO THIS FORM.I'D BE HAPPY IF SOMEONE COULD ADVISE ME ON HOW TO FIX OR RESET THE JUKEBOX TO ITS FACTORY DEFAULT.BEST REGARDS,FAISAL.
B000026D6I,4.0,i cannot say how much i love this player from creative. it has tons of features (some you'll probably never use, like the eax processing) and 6gb of storage, it also has an easy to navigate menu with two settings, one for novices and one for advanced users. in terms of sound quality the freq. response is fairly nice for this type of player and the signal to noise ratio is above most of the mp3's i have (S.N.R &gt; 90db). the unit is also only the size of a normal cd player, which is nice compared to some of the huge bulky models like archos models. the only reason that i gave the nomad 4 stars is because of the usb port (too slow) and the limited battery life. it's nice that creative is at least addressing one of these issues in a new nomad player coming out with a fire wire port and an usb port.
B000026D6I,4.0,Amazon has a great deal on this player.  Almost all other places charge $700 for it.  Get it here.As others have said the Jukebox does have its flaws.  The instruction manual is horrendous.  I've never seen a worse manual and I hope I never see another like it again.  Charging the batteries up for the Jukebox is a royal pain since after the batteries are at 100% it will then start draining them for another charge.  Speaking about battries be VERY careful when inserting them.  The polarites (where the positve and negative go) are very weird so use caution.  I also have a great deal of problems putting WAV's onto the player.  I have to convert most of them to MP3's first and then play them or else I get goobldy gook.However, the Jukebox is the biggest MP3 player available.  Navigation is remarkably easy (turn off Novice mode the second you get it).  The USB connection works super fast and an average MP3 will be on the player in less then 4 seconds.  The bundled software for PC is excellent and is also very useful just for ripping MP3's.
B000026D6I,4.0,I have been very interested in reading through the reviews, especially not being a potential buyer, but now a long time user. Firstly remember nothing is perfect and not all people are going to be pleased! It doesn't get a five rating because as mentioned by other reviewers the battery life does not really equate to the required portability of some users. However I do get a lot of use from it, in the car it plugs into the line in, it gets used on the plane when travelling and when visiting London it is connected with the line out to the system there, giving me access to most of my music collection. Its use is simple and the structure of the access to the files is great giving multiple methods of accessing the type of music you want and the tracks easily moved to the playlist. As for the problems experienced in ripping and loading from the PC. Personally I use MusicMatch Juke box to rip, organize and play music on my PC so the files are already ripped and categorized etc by the CDDB system. This makes it very easy to transfer music to the Jukebox as the Playcenter software which comes with it enables you to locate the folders/files on your PC and just load them across to your Jukebox, this I have found to be very quick, and on the occassion that I did find one corrupt file is was to do with the original ripping and not the transfer. It is a great means to move and listen to a lot of music, its not a put in your pocket whist you jog player. The only thing that it was missing in my opion was its inability to act as a stand alone player, which has now been addressed by the Cambridge Labs Playdock, which I have just ordered! The Nomad Jukebox is a very good product, just not perfect.
B000026D6I,2.0,I would smash this piece of junk into a wall if it wasn't a gift. Without wasting my time and listing all of my annoyance as other users have listed, but talk about frustration with charging the 3hour-long-usage battery!!! without exaggeration, 80% of the time when i have left the batteries in charge over night, only to discover the next day at the gym or in the cab that the machine is LOW ON BATTERY AND SHUTTING DOWN! My other set of batteries won't even charge at all!I've written complaints to Nomad and called, but what can you expect from an idiotic online tech support when the parent company has created such a NON user-friendly meretricious trash.Keep in the mind, when they say &quot;music for hours&quot;, its only for 3! (unless you want to keep it at stationary for your car or home)And if you are an outdoor runner, look else where, this machine is a free weight in itself.
B000026D6I,4.0,Let me just say one thing - 20 GigabytesLet that sink in - 400 CDs - Your entire CD Collection with plenty of room to spare - and portable. This is the 21st Century.I popped out the drive, popped in a 20gb notebook drive and in 15 min I have the ultimate MP3 player.... Check the web for instructions on how to do it - it is sooooo easy!!!!OK, a couple of drawbacks - It took 2 days to download the music (and 1 day of getting my id3v2 tags all in order) and yes, it takes 5 min to boot, and sometimes can take a min or 2 to change screens, but when your playlist reads &quot;1 of 4500 items&quot; you forget all that.
B000026D6I,5.0,This player is amazing.  It's like carrying Sound Blaster Live with you anywhere you want.  Some people have been saying there are major flaws in the system, such as low battery life, and no car adapetr kit.  Car kits are available anywhere, the same ones used for cd players. They are obviously mistaken about battery life, i have used my batteries for a good 4 hours, and on top of that they give you a second battery pack, so in total you get 8 hours of listening, and never have to buy batteries for the system again, because when it is plugged in, the batteries automatically recharge.  The storage capacity is obviously amazing, and considering this, the player is extremely compact.  Pound for pound it beats any other mp3 player on the market in quiality (with sound blaster qualities) and storage.  a must buy for mp3 lovers.
B000026D6I,5.0,Not only does the Nomad Jukebox support Mp3 Files,  WMA (windows media), and WAVE, but Data files as well. Thats true, with the latest firmware update, you can store any kind of data into your nomad jukebox. The Latest Firmare upgrade takes care of the few problems it had when it was first released giving me a big impression from Creative Labs commitment to excellence. The ripping process and transfer rate increased dramatically. It takes a little getting used to at first in getting to know the Playcenter software that manages your transfer of files. The CDDBA support is fast and easy to set up. I recommend this product, it sure as hell beats the original tag. It is well worth it.
B000026D6I,5.0,Let me get this straight... you want to carry a $450 gadget with a hard drive in it with you when you jog? No sir!I have been using the nearest product to a competitor for monthes... the Personal Jukebox 100 from Han-Go electronics, both the 4.68 and 6.4gig versions. The Creative Nomad JB is by far a better developed, more feature laden product. It has many, many improvements over the PJB-100 including the excellent software that allows you to cue up an unlimited number of MP3 tracks to transfer then go away while the USB chugs along. The PJB-100 makes you go in small bunches of tracks a directory at a  time then puts them in Alphabetical order no matter the album order. The only way to preserve order in the PJB-100 is to rip directly to the unit which leaves no MP3 on your computer, and is slower than a modern PC as well.By comparison the Nomad preserves album order by default and organizes automatically by Playlist, Album, Artist, and Genre. The PJB requires you to make playlists when transferring from the PC by making 'copies' of the tracks on the unit. These take up no space but you can't manipulate the playlists except when connected to the PC. The Nomad lets you do all this easily with the unit itself, a much better method.Battery life... The PJB-100 lasts 12 full hours of continuous use on a charge of its Lithium Ion battery. The Nomad claims 4 hours but this is dependant upon many other factors. Like how well behaved the Nickel Metal-Hydride batteries are. This is the kind that has a 'memory' and degrades rapidly if not completely exhausted, then completely charged. The normal use pattern of this sort of unit means this isn't going to happen. I feel that Creative's including a second set is more ominous than friendly. And they warn on several labels and stickers to use Only Creative NiMh batteries as replacements even though they are nominally the same as any other 1.2 volt, AA form rechargable except in that NimH and Nicads have different discharge curves. I do not choose to experiment with a widget this expensive. And at any rate the unit is best suited for staionary, home use where it can remain plugged in.The PJB-100 has a car kit. This is a BAD thing. In use one failed with a broken line out jack... it only has ONE! Even after getting warranty repairs the unit failled again only weeks later from HD death. This time out of warranty. The second unit started making model helicopter noises when the HD runs so it lives in semi retirement at home now. We will see how well the Nomad likes the highways but I suspect it will stand up to the vibration and bouncing a little better. It is a sturdier sort of creature to be sure.EAX effects... yawn. You can distort and twist your music in a wide variety of fashions. I use MP3 to AVOID this. What would be usefull is Not included. That is Normalization. Using WinAmp you can have you choice of free normalization plug-ins. MusicMatch Jukebox used to have a normalization option but it never worked right and is now absent from the current version. CD's do not have equal levels... much less Mp3's ripped from them. Anyone who has listened to a playlist from many different CD's can recall turning up the volume to hear a quiet track then being blasted into next week by the next track from a louder Cd. This is also what keeps Windows Media Player 7 and RealPlayer from being usefull MP3 players.Still... I like everything about the design of this thing except the shape. The PJB-100 is squarish. At least it has a flat surface on the bottom and fits in a large pocket. The Nomad is CD player shaped sorta. But there is no convenient way to HOLD it. The PJB-100 comes with a case that shows it's display and exposes it's controls. The Nomad case cannot be used while playing it. No hole for the jack or controls. Just a bag. And it is not going in anyone's pockets. Again... much more suited to live on the shelf hooked into the stereo. The PJB-100 comes with a mini-plug to RCA phono-plug 'Y' cable to connect to the stereo. Not so the Nomad though it DOES have 2 lineouts and surround capability. Very nice.There is currently no control to use with the IR port and no 12 volt car adapter though Creative say both are coming. ... As the market grows the prices go low. Enjoy!
B000026D6I,3.0,I picked one of these up recently, and overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  I wish I could give it 3 and a half stars, but 3 will do.  Here's why:The First two days after buying it:  No real problems.  Unit worked great, and I dumped a full 6 gigs of archived music onto it without too much hassle.  The Creative Playcenter software was fairly easy to use, and I had to change a lot of the ID3 information with it, but overall it wasn't too painful.  I do wish that Creative would dump the stupid-looking pseudo-dialogs in their software and devote their time to slicker functionality.  The fact that I can't resize the Playcenter window drives me up the wall every time I open it -- you only get to pick from two small sizes.  Also, how about a pack-in utility to generate ID3 information based on file name?  I had to grab a shareware tagger.On the evening of the third day, I powered up the Nomad for my daily walk (Yes, I've been walking with it, and it hasn't skipped once).  It hung at the 'Preparing Library' screen and never, ever advanced to the Active Queue List.  Pressing the reset button on the bottom of the unit didn't fix it.  Performing a drive cleanup from the maintenance menu didn't fix it.  Finally, I had to completely re-format the whole hard drive and that got it.  Then I had to download all my music to it all over again, and I had to change all the same ID3 information all over again...quite frustrating.  Tech support was quick to comment on the issue (I had a response the next day) but by then I'd already done the format.I realize that before the calamitous crash, I had flashed the Nomad's firmware to 2.91, the latest offered by the Creative website at the time.  It worked for my walk that night, but I wonder if performing the upgrade somehow changes how files are accessed on boot and that's why it crashed.  It's been about two weeks since I restored everything, and there have been no further problems.  In fact, they've added some good functionality, like being able to fast-forward through songs.Now that I've had a lot of time to play with the software (I have Playcenter version 2.5 now) and the hardware, I've decided that I probably can't live without my Nomad for long periods of time.  Being able to take a good portion of my CD collection with me is way, way cool.  I have some suggestions for those of you who are still experiencing problems, for what it's worth:*  Upgrade your Nomad firmware and PC software to the latest versions at Creative's website.  After flashing your firmware, FORMAT your hard drive, and consider losing your music collateral damage.  It'll be much more stable once you're current.  If you're just starting out, do this before you move any music over to it.*  I compressed all of my variable-bitrate and 128kbit .mp3 files to 112 without any audible loss of quality.  Doing this freed up about 20% more space for music.  Not bad!*  Grab a freeware ID3 editor/tagger online.  The tools supplied with the Nomad just aren't good enough.  There are some great bulk-edit utilities out there.*  Creative's Nomad FAQ says you can jog with your player.  I've done it and it works great -- it has yet to skip.  I'd recommend a belt with a pouch for carrying.  This gives it a little more shock resistance as well.
B000026D6I,5.0,If you are in the market for an MP3 player this has to be the best sounding, the easiest to use and the most RELIABLE unit around. I had a Riovolt first but it was hopeless at playing CD-RW discs (yes it said CD-RW compatitable on the box), then I had an Archos 6000 that melted (literally) when it was charging.So purchasing the Nomad and its a dream come true. I can store 2500 96bit/sec high quality WMA files (WMA is better than MP3), arrange the songs into albums, genres, artists and playlists, which is a godsend when looking up a specific song or to play songs in a specific order. One feature which is so handy that it brought tears to my eyes, is the ability to add songs to the active playlist as you go, without interupting the current song playing. The included software is easy to use and enables CD ripping, organizing and titleing of your favourite songs. It only takes a few moments to transfer a lot of files through the included USB lead.The unit itself is a very sleek silver-blue affair that has high-quality fixtures, positive-acting buttons and a very clear backlit LCD that has a very easy-to-understand menu system, backed up by 3 navigation buttons that aid you through the menus. The drive unit itself is very quiet and smooth and is responsive when navigating songs.The unit has oodles of sound-tweaking modes such as a graphic equaliser, environment settings and stereo wide modes, but even in normal mode, the unit sounds so damn good you'll hardly use the sound modes. Hook it up to your stereo via its Line out and the sound quality is amazing, it rivals a CD player.Some customers complain that the unit 'skips' but I don't have a habit of bashing my Nomad on the floor and when its safely tucked away in my pocket, it never ever skips when im walking or running. Also the battery life is very acceptable (I can squeeze 6 hours out of mine) if you follow the charging procedures, and in fairness to Creative Labs, you do get 2 packs of NimH batteries. What more do you want?!Overall this player is so damn good if it was a woman i'd marry it and I hope to keep this player for many years to come, (its THAT good) :-)
B000026D6I,5.0,It supports all of the standard MP3 encoding rates (56K to 320K). They are  also planning support for other Codecs soon( like WMA and others). This is  one of the greatest features in my book. You can pick the bit rate and  codec that best records your music, even mixing between different codecs in  the same playlist without any pause in the music.The recording feature  is also real nice. Even if you don't want to buy a mike, you can connect it  to your stereo like a tape deck and record things (LPs, FM, other tapes,  etc.) You can then use the host app to add the info and even upload back to  drop into some music processing to 'clean-up' and encode them.Even  though I only had one for a short time, I was spoiled :-) I didn't listen  to a radio the whole time, 'cause I had all my tunes with me wherever I  was.The EAX effects are great! Not just 'Bass' and 'More Bass&quot;, but  full 3-band EQ and some reverb things which are good. You can even slow  down and speed up the playback (doesn't change the pitch like a  tape).The batteries lasted 3 to 4 hours (one time is was almost 5  hours). This was fine with me. I could plug into the car's lighter plug and  not only play, but recharge the batteries. That and the unit looks HOT!  Everyone asked me what it was and when they listened to it they knew they  had to get one. Count me in!
B000026D6I,5.0,I NORMALY DON'T DO THIS TYPE OF THING, BUT I JUST HAD TO SAY HOW MUCH I HAVE ENJOYED THIS PLAYER.  I READ EVERYTHING I COULD BEFORE I PURCHASED THE JUKEBOX. SOME PEOPLE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS OR THAT BUT MOSTLY THEY ENJOYED IT.. MAN I LOVE THIS THING!! I SIMPLY DOWNLOADED TO MY COMPUTER THE MUSIC I WANTED TO LISTEN TO AND THEN DOWNLOADED TO THE JUKEBOX, WHAT COULD BE MORE SIMPLE.. THANKS FOR SUCH A SIMPLE EASY TO USE SYSTEM.. I LOOK FOWARD TO USING THIS THING.  I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS THING TO ANYONE WHO SIMPLY WANTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR MUSIC IN A PORTABLE FORMAT.....
B000026D6I,4.0,This has everything I want with one exception.  There is no adapter for the car for power.  I purchased the car adapter kit and you get another pair of earphones, which you do not need, and an adapter so the player can use the tape deck in your car to play through your car speakers.  You also get a carrying case which I already have from the deluxe package.  You end up paying $50 for the tape adapter.  Just one more piece in the original package would have made a complete system.  Other than that it is really great, great sound, great display, ease of use.
B000026D6I,4.0,Alright, what everyone is saying is true, the ability to take 150 CDs worth of music is very cool.  Unfortunately I fell into the NEW product syndrome.  Because it's so new, if you have any problems there is no help for it.  During the software installation, the software was not able to add an entry to the registry (mediaman.reg) which prevented it from working.  A call to Creative Tech Support came back with the &quot;re-load&quot; Windows answer.  I laughed and loaded the software on another machine and copied the registry setting over (4 hours later).  After 4 hours, I assure you I have the coolest MP3 player on the face of the planet and would not give it up for anything.  Moral of the story:  The Jukebox is new and if it all goes right you will be VERY happy, if not you may have to wait for happiness and be left wondering why you spent $450 on this 3 pound paperweight.
B000026D6I,5.0,Great product that will probably get better.  The manual is poor, especially if you're dealing with a Mac.  I also didn't realize that you needed a USB port to connect to your computer.  Once I started using my Mom's iMac, everything went well.  The headphones are a great set of $19 headphones, if you want more, go out and buy a better set.  The carrying case is cheesy but I didn't buy this machine for the carrying case so I went out and bought a better one.  The volume levels are standard for a walkman, I'm hoping that I can amp it even more with a set of high quality headphones.  Overall, this product is exactly what it claims to be, a jukebox capable of storing an incredible amount of music in a very small package.  I can't believe the price when you compare it with much (much) smaller MP3's that can hold only a fraction of the music you can load into the Jukebox.  Still, if you don't like tinkering with your equipment (I do, my wife has accused me of now living a life where I never take off my headphones) you may not like this product.  For me, I couldn't imagine a better product for the price.
B000026D6I,4.0,when I DJ, but now that I own two Nomad Jukeboxes, I carry a hell of a lot less... 2 Nomads and a crate of Albums I haven't had time to burn to MP3 yet.I encode all my MP3s at a very high (256kb/s +) bitrate, and other mp3 players just couldn't handle the size of these files, when I saw the Jukebox, I thought my prayers were answered, and in many ways (all but one) the gods of music smiled down on me.People have complained about the size of the units; they are the same size as a portable CD player, not very large at all. Granted they are not as small as other players, but then again, they do not have a harddrive in them holding up to 6GB of data, most topping out at 96MB.The sound quality is great using the 2 line out jacks on the rear of the unit, hooked up to a mixing board and amp, you would not know that you are not listening to a CD. The headphones are garbage, throw em out and buy a better pair, but otherwise Creative has paid alot of attention on the sound quality, and it shows.My only gripe is the unit is VERY SLOW. Once you load it up (i have over 800 titles on each) and create a bunch of playlists, it can be almost painfull to bootup and start playing. Searching for songs can be trying at times, but once you get used to its quirks, it is acceptable.I have yet to see anything that can compete with this unit, and I look forward to firmwear updates to speed the unit up a bit (PLEASE!).Note to Creative: Speed it up, and get the 5th star :)
B000026D6I,5.0,Why anyone would think that this is a bad product is crazy.  This is the best thing since sliced bread.  The moment I saw it, I knew I had to have it, and I was not disapointed at all.The headphones aren't good quality (say other reviewers), but really, if you buy a portable CD player or any other portable device, you can't expect top-of-the-line headphones.  So buy better ones for a few bucks.  That's what I did.All in all, I have definately gotten my money's worth.  I can take this on planes, trains, or automobiles, and really, you can't do better.
B000026D6I,5.0,I've actually owned several MP3 players include models from Rio, Sony, and a few generic. The Creative Nomad's are by far superior. First and fore most, the capacity puts it into a class of it's own. I have a 120GB music server at my house, buying a 64mb MP3 player was out of the question, who has the time or wants to deal with the hassle of transferring files you would like to listen to all the time. But I also like the organization and play list accessibility/features of the device. I should mention if your interested, you will want to buy the new model which has a 20GB drive.
B000026D6I,5.0,&quot;Imagine every piece of music you own, will own, and have downloaded from the Internet in one hand-held portable device. The Creative NOMAD  Jukebox holds 150 CDs of digital MP3 audio. It's the size of a CD player,  and you can take it with you wherever you go - home, work, or travel.  Built-in EAX&trade; audio technology and FourPointSurround&trade; speaker support give  you the ability to customize your music for the most immersive desktop or  home audio environment imaginable.The advanced onboard DSP provides  headphone spatialization effects, environmental effects, and allows you to  manually adjust the amount of reverb, bass, treble, mid, or mid frequency  ranges on the fly.Advanced recording features via the line-in jack  gives you the capability to record from external devices - even replacing a  DAT, with dual band recording up to 48kHz. Your recordings can be easily  ported back to the PC with the bundled Creative PlayCenter&trade; 2 software for  editing, encoding, and cleanup with your favorite music or sound production  tools.&quot;Now that's what I call cool! Look no further..this is it.
B000026D6I,4.0,Creative, you did a really nice job with this product!Ithink [most of the complaints] can be ignored once you have the headphones on and are listening to your music.  The software is updateable, so the very few quirks will be worked out and they'll also implement remote control capabilities.It's a nice toy, a little expensive and hungry for batteries, but worth it to me.
B000026D6I,1.0,Is the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox a nice machine ? Yes, it sure is. But it doesn't live up to the expectations. Mainly because of a number of software implementations (or lack thereof), which might be overcome in the next releases of the Nomad Player software and the bundled PC software Package 'Playcenter'. For now, the Nomad Jukebox package doesn't cut it for me, and as such, I have returned, for the first time in my e-shopping life, a product because it didn't met my expectations...A large array of magazine advertisements and articles would let you to believe that the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox is the best of the best of MP3 players. Well, because you can read all about the good stuff about this player in other places, let me focus on the 'features' that ruined my experience with this device.Missing from the package: the line-in cable to record music onto the Nomad player. When I buy a 400+ dollar device, I don't want to have to run to the store to buy a cable to hook the Nomad to my tape deck - especially not because the recording capabilities are one of the advertised features. And, by the way, the cables to connect the Nomad Jukebox to your speakers (or amplifier) are also not included.Unable to record MP3 format. Yes, the Nomad Jukebox can record through it's line-in jack, but only in the bulky WAV format. You then have to upload the file to the PC, convert WAV to MP3 format, and redownload. Ugly. Probably caused by the fact that there is not enough cpu horsepower in the Nomad to encode in MP3 format. This limits the amount of music that you can record on the Nomad Jukebox, as a WAV file is 20x larger than the same MP3 file.No battery life information. There is no way to see the charge-status of the batteries in the Nomad Jukebox. So you don't know if your batteries are fully charged while you are connected to an AC outlet, and you don't know how much longer you will be able to listen to the music while playing on batteries. Ugly - I thought every battery powered device offered a battery status indicator.Ugly filing mechanism. When files are copied from the PC to the Nomad Jukebox player, the filename (and directory structure) on the PC is lost. So if you organized your MP3 files on your PC by means of directories and filenames, you will find this a very unpleasant surprise. While downloading songs, the Nomad Jukebox makes its own filename for each MP3 file, based on the information in the ID3 fields of the MP3 file. And let me tell you: most MP3 files you will have do not have this TAG properly filled out, so make sure you have a few extra days to correct all this on your PC before downloading your music to the Nomad Jukebox. Getting all the ID3 tags of all your MP3 files right is mandatory if you want to use the Nomad Jukebox, a long and tedious job.Download issues Because of the 'Ugly Nomad Jukebox Filing Mechanism' as described above, downloading your music collection from your PC to the Nomad Jukebox is likely to fail. This download stops whenever 2 files with the same 'new derived filename' are detected. And given the fact that all your PC directory and filename information is trashed, and the filenames are deducted from the embedded ID3 information, this is very likely to happen a few times to you.Unable to search for songs. On the MP3 player, you can not search for a song (with the name), or for any keyword (i.e. word in the title of a song). The only searches that are supported are artist searches. Euh ? Did somebody fail to implement all other software routines ? This is very user un-friendly.Unable to navigate within a single track: you can't fast-forward within the same track - real annoying if you are listening to a one-hour radio show or another lengthy piece of music - you always need to (re)start from the beginning of the song.No way to update song information on the Nomad Player. OK, here is the deal: you are listening to your music while traveling, and you notice that the song-information is not accurate. You want to correct the name of the artist, the song, the album, the genre, or anything about the song. Impossible. You need to note it down on a piece of paper, change it on the MP3 song on your PC, and redownload the song to the Nomad. Very user un-friendly. In essence, this also means there is no syncing of any information between the Nomad and the PC - you can only download (wav, mp3) and upload (wav only) between the PC and the Nomad Jukebox, there is really no syncing like with a Palm-pilot to ensure that information is updated once you change it on the PC or the player.Uploading MP3's doesn't work. Surely a software issue, implemented to restrict digital copying ? Frankly, I don't care. When I go down to my friends with my MP3 player, I want them to be able to read/copy what I have on the hard-disc. And I want to be able to hook my player to their PC, download songs, and later on (if I like them) upload them to my PC for backup purposes. I can do this with all removable media MP3 devices, why can't I do this with the Creative Nomad Jukebox ?Hey, perhaps some of these features are available on the Nomad Jukebox, and I just didn't find it. That's definitely possible. The printed documentation included in the package and the software demo included on the CD-Rom are definitely not complete...
B000026D6I,5.0,Always being annoyed at the portable mp3 players only having 64 mb, the  Creative Nomad Jukebox is a godsend.  Offering a whopping 6 gb of storage,  the Jukebox is the first viable mass storage mp3 player.  Of course I  discount the Personal Jukebox because it was very expensive for only 4 gb  of space and very little features.  As Creative being one of the leading  manufactures of Portable Audio Devices, they have the ability to create a  wonderful product that will be a godsend to the mp3 industry.  The Jukebox  also will be able to hook up to a stereo system and be controlled by remote  controll further adding to the Jukebox's cast array of features.
B000026D6I,1.0,Bought it about a year ago, it worked all right. The usual skipping and stalling, and once in a while had battery charging problems, but it worked. I picked it up yesterday after not using it for a while, and now it doesn't work at all unless plugged into the wall. I've tried changing the batteries, turning it on while it's plugged in and then unplugging it, but it turns off. It doesn't even show the "shutting down" text, it just goes blank. Called support but they won't answer any questions as the warranty ran out, very helpful people.
B000026D6I,4.0,I purchased my Nomad Jukebox last month at Best Buy. Setup is simple, the software works great. Biggest disappointment, they want you to charge the batteries 12 full hours before using. I'm sure everyboby is doing that, ha ha. Even though I followed instructions the best play time I've gotten is appr. 3 hours. They send you a second set of batteries, but they have to be charged in the unit so I usually keep recharging the same 4 over and over unless I have say 16 hours between uses. I've got 1400 songs on mine and still have appr. 300 mg left. It plays beautifully, the sound is great, downloading is a snap. The biggest quirk I have found is when setting up a playlist I spend a few minutes doing that, it plays the first song or so and then says the playlist is empty. Other times it plays for hours so I haven't figured that out yet. Each time you gear up it takes more than a minute to load the library, a bit annoying. One of my biggest deals is with Creative, I have e-mailed them a question a month ago and have yet to receive a reply. The unit runs on 12 volt DC. The AC adapter puts out 12.29 volts DC. I ask them if I could run the unit on a standard cigarette lighter wich puts out appr. 14 volts wth the vehicle running. Haven't tried it yet, don't want to burn up This $500. toy just yet. I recommend it, but it needs longer battery life, tech support that will answer your questions and it will be hard to beat.  Also a separate charging cradle for the second set of batteries would be nice. Nice heck, it's a necessity.Rick Hood
B000026D6I,5.0,This is the coolest piece of equipment that I have bought so far. It stores all my MP3s easily, and I still have a gigabyte left without having deleted any of the music that came with it. It was cool seeing that my nomad JB came with lot's of different types of music from asian pop to spoken books (frankenstein and Robinson Crusoe).The menu is really set up perfectly. I can get to any of my hundred of songs quickly, of course I spent time setting all the info properly (title / artist / album / genre), but now, all of my mp3s are perfectly sorted in portable mp3 player. Also, there are really cool features like playback speed, enviromental settings, and other stuff. The uploading is really fast (and a good thing to, with so much to put on)There is only one small drawback that I can think of. The batterie life is way to short (they claim that it is 4 hours long). It is a good thing that they provide 2 sets of 4 batteries, so that I can at least have bothe sets fully charged and with me for long trips.Carl
B000026D6I,5.0,The principal complaints I'm reading are low battery life, the related issue of portability and a slow OS.  If the advertised four hours is &quot;low battery life&quot;, then battery life is low; however, understanding the power requirements of the device, I am pleased with the battery life.  Since batteries recharge in the device, even while it's playing (albeit more slowly), I don't often discharge the batteries, and I carry spares anyway.  Creative ships two sets of rechargable batteries with the player.  I've also used Eveready Ni-MH rechargables and recharged the Creative batteries in an Eveready charger without a hitch.  Rechargables slowly discharge even if you don't use them, so you should recharge spares occassionally.Booting the device takes 10-15 seconds.  It's a little irksome, at times, but it's quite tolerable.  Clearly, faster response time is always better.  Once the device is booted, it responds quickly in my experience.  I'd like to see a more effective album/title search feature, like a bisection search.  Ideally, I'd see the first and last titles in the first half of a list followed by the first and last titles in the last half of the list, then I'd pick the half of the list I want to search further, and so on.I've had few problems with portability.  Using a carrying case designed for a portable CD player, I've walked the streets and bladed with the device.  I wouldn't worry about biking with it either.  If I were a runner, I'd use a solid state device and live with its limited capacity while running, but I'm very happy with the portability of the Jukebox.  I had a minor fall while blading with the device, and it held up nicely, not even a skip.  Understanding the potential for disk head crash, I don't recommend too much rough and tumble.  On the other hand, I bought the extended warranty.I don't understand the volume gripes, but I haven't destroyed my hearing with heavy metal yet, either.  Wynonna is more my speed.  The volume meter varies from 1 through 20, and I like 12 in a quiet setting.  The default is 16, and I find that setting a little loud.  I don't understand the headphone gripes either, but I'm not a phonophile.  The sound quality seems better than the headphones I had used with my portable Philips CD player.I'm aware of one competitive device, the Archos Jukebox 6000.  It also features a 6 gb hard drive, usb connection, some EAX-like features and generally seems a lot like the Nomad, but it looks very different, rectangular like a portable cassette player.  It has a smaller cache, only 2MB, not enough for an entire song, compared with 8MB on the Nomad...The only other portable mp3 player I'd consider at this point is one of the portable CDRW devices with mp3 playback.  Some of those devices also play standard CDs.  A 6 gig drive will probably hold all the music I'll ever want in one place at one time, so I like the hard drive approach, but I'd definitely hate to deal with a disk crash.  I've seen a nice looking CDRW device with mp3 playback and an 8MB cache from Sony...  I didn't notice if it played standard CDs, and I suspect it would burn an mp3 file on a CDW much more slowly than the Nomad writes its hard drive.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox has a secret it isn't telling.  Someday, soon, it will morph into a handheld/wearable, general purpose computer, or a peripheral for a palmtop at least.  The next Nomad will probably have a 20 gig drive, but something bigger and better is always six months away these days.
B000026D6I,4.0,Just some additional notes after using the player some more, to add to my previous review.First, I was incorrect when I said you could not delete songs and playlists on the player itself. You can, it's just buried on a totally different menu, so that you have to jump back and forth from your active playlist. I guess this is for safety's sake, but it sure makes deleting a pain to do. But you can, that's the good news!Second, Creative has just released a firmware upgrade that does address a number of issues, and really makes this player rock! The firmware not only lets you use WMA files, it adds the fast forward and rewind feature, louder sound, and gapless playback. This upgrade is a must-have if you get this player!Still can't bump my review rating up to 5 stars, since battery life still stinks. But this definitely strengthens my recommendation that this is an MP3 player well worth having.
B000026D6I,5.0,The reason people get this over (or alongside) other MP3 players is that they need the storage space.  I am still in awe of how much music you can fit in this thing! Here's a breakdown of what I think: Sound: Very good.  Sure, the EAX is a little gimmicky, but at least you have a good equalizer.  I don't know why people complain about the lack of volume, this thing is as loud as my discman.  The headphones are better than average. Battery Life: Decent.  People complain that AA alkalines don't work with it; of course they don't, the instructions tell you as much!  You get two sets of good rechargeable NiMH batteries. Interface: Very good.  Easy, intuitive and packed with features to organize your music. Manual: Very good.  Those who think this is a bad manual should look at the Rio 500's (an otherwise fine machine), which gives new meaning to aweful. Software: Very Good.  Easy and fast.With the new firmware update, even faster! Overall, I am very happy with this product and recommend it highly!
B000026D6I,3.0,My previous review of this product stated that this player was a fairly good buy. Not so anymore. It's simply too heavy, large and bulky. The main advantage this player has is it's rather large 6 GB capacity, which I never was able to fill. However, it's negatives outweigh the positives. After using it for a couple of months, the batteries stopped holding a charge, and would only give me a half hour or so of play time.The issues mentioned in my old review such as the inability to fast forward/rewind and inability to upload songs from the player have been resolved with recent firmware and software updates. The headphones are great, and they served me for a long, long time, even after I stopped using the Jukebox itself.In my opinion, it is a far better idea to purchase a portable CD player that is able to play MP3 CDs, such as a Sony MP3 CD discman. It's far cheaper, lighter and easier to use. However, you obviously need a burner to burn the MP3 CDs... or, go buy a newer generation of this product!OLD REVIEW --I just got the Creative Nomad Jukebox today (in blue!) and so far I absolutely love it. I even rollerbladed with it. True, it is a bit bulky, but thats only because it has a laptop hard drive inside it. And hey, it may drain the batteries (or so people say), but when I used it for my 30-45 minute roller blade trip, it served me well. The batteries didn't die on me, and it was almost fresh out of the box. The batteries hadn't even had much charging yet. I don't have any idea why the people are complaining about the headphones and the volume settings. The headphones are comparable to the Sony Backphones, which are probably the greatest lightweight headphones ever made. The headphones are a bit tight out of the box, but I'm sure they will loosen with time. As for the volume issue, you've got to be either deaf, or standing in the middle of a busy airport runway if it's not loud enough for you.  The annoying things about it are:  1. The lack of fast forward/rewind functions  2. The large size (about the size of a Sony Discman player) 3. The delicate state of the player (Although I haven't done this, I don't think a Hard Drive would survive a fall) 4. The player's software doesn't allow you to download songs from the player into the computerThe positive features are: 1. SUPERIOR sound quality 2. Tons of EAX settings, and other sound settings. 3. EXTREME capacity. I dont think I will ever be able to fully use up the 6 gigabyte capacity of this great MP3 player. 4. Comes with an AC adapter. 5. Comes with a leather carry case. 6. The super-fast file transfer time. You can load a whole album on this baby in under 3 minutes. My old Parallel Port MP3 player took 15 minutes for about 3-4 songs. 7. The player comes preloaded with hours of music of different genres, including Pop, Classical, Rock and Electronica.All and all, the positives outweigh the negatives. Of course, you could wait for a better player, but why? [Thats my way of thinking ;-) ]
B000026D6I,3.0,I thing the Nomad Jukebox is a no a very good stuff. Easy to organize your files but you can use the batteries just for one hour. The Creative Play Center is not a good stuff too.
B000026D6I,4.0,This is a great gizmo, I got it last week as a birthday present from my wife. But, folks, you better charge this sucker for 12 hours after it's out of the box and before you even begin to play with it. I didn't and now I'm paying the price. My player shuts down after maybe 20 minutes of play. I'm recharging it overnight or during the day now.  Basically, it's a hard drive without the laptop. I used to keep all my MP3's on a Zip drive connected to my laptop. I'd like to take all my music with me, yes, but Creative has GOT to do something about the battery life in the next edition.Bottom line - great product, lousy battery life, like everyone else has been saying.
B000026D6I,3.0,I had high hopes for the Nomad Jukebox. I purchased it because of theglowing reviews I found everywhere, especially on Creative's excellent support newsgroup.Maybe my high hopes set false expectations, or maybe I'm just though to please, but I was not thrilled with my purchase.I purchased it hoping to go jogging with it, but learned from comments on the newsgroup that because of the shock I better not use it for jogging if I wanted it to continue to work.  It was also a bit too bulky and heavy for jogging.  I thought maybe I could at least use on the treadmill at the health club (i.e. put the unit on the treadmill newspaper rack instead of carrying it) but I never got a chance.Before I tried using at the treadmill, I downloaded the new firmware and installed on my unit, and after that it would not boot!  Creative's tech support said &quot;Wow, I've never heard of a problem like that.&quot;  To their credit and Amazon's, they were both very willing to allow me to return it, either for repair (at Creative) or replacement (via Amazon.)Amazon immediately shipped me another one when they got my email, but ironically they misshipped (I don't blame them, I've order many times from Amazon and this was the first mixup.)  By then, I decided to simply &quot;return&quot; it for good and wait for the item to &quot;mature.&quot;  I told them not to bother sending me another, and I returned both the dead unit and the misshipment.Additional info about the NJB: The carrying case does not have a place for the poor quality headphones, and you can't listen to the NJB when it is in the case because of headphone jack gets in the way (unless you turn the NJB sideways, then the case won't close.)On the positive side, it is a really nice to have all your music in one little box you can carry (almost) anywhere, and if I wanted to use it for different reasons (i.e. not jogging and I carried a backpack that had a pocket to carry it, and the firmware upgrade had worked) I could probably recommend it  The newsgroup is a big plus.On the other hand it is a first generation unit and I think within one year there will be some much better offerings from Creative and other companies.  If you'll be kicking yourself for spending the money today when the unit you *really* want comes out in a year, don't buy it today.  If you won't mind shelving it in a year to buy the latest and greatest, go ahead and get it; you'll probably be happy you did (but not for jogging!)
B000026D6I,4.0,I love this product! When the Jukebox first hit the market I was interested in it because of the sheer volume of music that the it could hold. It was too pricey for me... and I balked at laying out that kind of money for this type of device. When the price dropped... I pounced on one. It is by far the most used used electronic gadget that I own. It is a perfect traveling companion for me since I don't like carrying all of my CD's on road trips and I can bring along half of my music collection without the headaches of storage space. I have found that WMA at 64kbs music sounds as good to me as 128kbp of MP3 formatted music. Since the Jukebox holds 1000 hours of MP3 formatted music I have realistically doubled my listening pleasure. The only drawbacks are load time tranferring music from my PC to the Jukebox via the USB transfer cable. I wish it came with a Firewire transfer capability. The other drawback is low battery life. I only get about 2 1/2 hours of use with the rechargeable batteries that it came with. Solution: By more rechargeable batteries and a charger. I travel by car for long periods of time and found that a cigarette lighter power adapter works great and saves my batties for later use. I can't tell you how much I have enjoyed this device!
B000026D6I,5.0,How many people have owned a smaller mp3 product only capable of storing maybe 40 minutes of CD-quality audio?  Could you alter the way it sounds?  Thought not!  Well, now you can store up to 150 hours of CD-quality music,  add Environmental Sound Effects, change simple things like the bass or  treble.  All you will have to worry about now is 'How do I fill this up? '
B000026D6I,4.0,This thing is quite good but is lacking in the audio output department. Let me explain; While it seems to do everything very well,it does not have a lot of OMPHhh as far as the volume control is concerned. According to the specs, the Nomad Jukebox is supposed to put out a 100 mw signal; my Sony Discman's 30 mw signal will just about deafen me, the Jukebox won't even come close, even though it's rated output is over three times higher. If it wasn't for that one item, I would have given it a perfect five.:')
B000026D6I,5.0,I just received this as a gift, and it is great.  Ripping a CD to the Jukebox is extremely fast.  It's capacity to hold all the music it claims is right on target.  Yeah, it's too heavy if you want to carry it while jogging, et.al., but for me, it is definately much easier to transport my extensive collection of music.  I travel quite a bit, and Creative Labs has made my future trips (packing included) a piece of cake!
B000026D6I,4.0,I've been waiting for something like this for forever. I've gone through my share of MP3 players, minidisc players, walkmans and discmans, but so far nothing has had the versatility that the Nomad Jukebox has. My problem is that whenever I travel I insist that I can't survive without bringing my entire CD collection, and it's annoying (and risky) to lug around that many CDs. Minidiscs provided a solution for a while, but it was to much hassle to spend so much time recording &amp; editing the minidiscs manually without the help of a computer program. MP3 players like the Rio 500 &amp; Nomad II are great for day use &amp; jogging, but most of the time 1 hour just doesn't cut it. MP3-CD players don't seem worth it to me because you still have to buy a CD burner &amp; carry around CDs. The Nomad Jukebox is for people who want a MASSIVE amount of music (6 GIGs, 100+ hours, which is 100x more than most Mp3 players, at around the same price) for use over a long period of time or at home.The Jukebox comes bundled with software for PlayCenter 2 (for the PC) or SoundJam (for Macs) to use for ripping CDs &amp; Mp3s from your computer to the Jukebox. It also comes with decent headphones (loudness is NOT a problem) &amp; a carrying case, plus all the necessary equipment for setting it up. Setup is pretty easy, and using the software is a lot more intuitive than I though it would be. It takes me around 5 minutes to rip a CD from my computer the the Nomad. The best feature by far is the OMD description searcher-- if you're online while your ripping CDs, the OMD finds the album name, year released, genre, artist, &amp; ALL the track names, so you don't have to type anything in. You can also rip Mp3s from the Nomad back to your computer. The songs in the Nomad can be categorized under Albums, Artists, Genres or Play Lists to make it easier to navigate. It supports data, mp3, wma, and wav files (plus many others). You can download updates [from the web] for better software or firmware for the player, so even if something isn't perfect now, in the future improvements will be available. The player also has an infrared port on the front for future additions (like a remote control). It comes with 2 hours of free music (mostly classical) and some Audio Books. It includes jacks for line-in recording from radios, microphones or stereos,  and line-out hookup to stereos or speakers.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox is a very new kind of Mp3 player, so it has a few MAJOR flaws:1) BATTERY POWER- Hard Drives tend to suck up an endless amount of power, and that's exactly what the Jukebox is-- a Hard Drive disguised as an Mp3 player. You can ONLY use the 4 rechargeable batteries that Nomad gives you (AA size) to run it without the AC adapter, and those only last around 2 hours by themselves. Nomad includes an extra set of 4 to replace them, but you always have to make sure they are fully charged. Maybe in the future there will be more options (battery pack?)2) WEIGHT - It's around the size of a first-generation CD player, and it weighs around 2 lbs with batteries. This isn't really a problem for me, but it depends what you want to use it for. It's not meant for use while jogging or biking, etc-- it's more for use over a long period of time away from home, on the bus/plane/dorm/in the car, or at home, plugged into the AC adapter and a pair of speakers. Besides the weight, in my opinion, it looks VERY nice- it has unique, smooth design, coloring and shape (and the LCD screen is easy to read).The Nomad Jukebox is the best in its category of high-capacity Mp3 players-- It holds 100 times more music than a normal Mp3 player, and its price has been drastically reduced, making it a lot more affordable than it was before. Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It is the best option for anyone who's ever wished they could bring all their CDs with them without actually having to CARRY them... and I think that I will be using it for a long, long time from now.
B000026D6I,5.0,THIS IS THE COOLEST MP3 PLAYER OUT THERE TODAY!!! I HAVE AMOST 2000 SONGS ON IT AND IT IS THE SIZE OF A CD WALKMAN!!!!! CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PLAYER!!!!
B000026D6I,4.0,I love the idea of being able to have all my mp3s in one mp3 player and am really intrested in buying this produce but I know that hard drives are Very sensitive to shocks and a slight bump or drop can destroy one. So if I happened to drop this Mp3 player would I lose my 400+ dollar investment? Because I know for a fact that if you drop a hard drive on a hard surface from the hight of  about 3 or 4 feet that drive will be permently destroyed.
B000026D6I,1.0,First off, this product does NOT support the WMA format (yet) nor is it SDMI compliant (yet).  I spent some time badgering the Creative Labs folks for any updates they might have kicking around in the labs for WMA support and was basically told to &quot;go away&quot;.  The short battery life and klunky interface make this a poor choice for a media player.  The capacity is great, but that's about it.  Bottom line: Not ready for prime time.  ...
B000026D6I,5.0,I read every single comment posted here before buying my Jukebox today. Most everything I saw people complaining about has been resolved with 2.56 firmware, and PlayCenter 2.1. The only thing not addressed was the battery life, which is hard to fix with software. You can now scan through songs by holding the skip button. Songs can be put in track order, and the data transfer rate jumped from 500k to over 3m.I love this device, and don't know how I lived with my Rio 500 (even with an extra 64 meg card) for so long. I still plan to use my Rio 500 because it is so much more portable, but this is great for my hour and a half commute to work, and while I'm at work (I'm a programmer, I just sit at a desk all day, so it doesn't have to be that portable).I haven't filled up the 6 gigs yet, but I see this as my only complaint, I really think 6 gigs is not enough. I have over 20 gigs in my personal collection right now, so there is NO WAY I'm going to be able to &quot;Take my whole CD collection with me&quot; as everyone says, but I can take a big chunk of it with me. I looked at some of the other devices (some which go up to 81gigs), but none of them had nearly the same feature set that the Nomad does. Plus I know and trust Creative. I knew with all the people complaining about not being able to scan tracks that it wouldn't take long for a firmware upgrade to come out to fix that, and by time I looked on their website it was already there!Price is not an issue. The Remote Solution 6 gig is still(much more), and it doesn't look anywhere as cool as this beauty. And it's lacking IR, and Line In recording. It has a better battery life but I wan't too worried about the batteries, since I'll usually be plugged in.I know it's missing some battery life, but since I don't care about that, I'm giving this the full five stars.
B000026D6I,3.0,Well, first of all I have to spit my negative comments about this device. The thing that bugs me the most of all is the digital (delayed) volume control. Volume should be controlled analog instead of 20 steps from almost silence to pretty loud. Another thing is the ugly font. Why is creative trying to make an 'original' font in a 6 x 7 cell block ? Some letters don't even match with the same font family. The transfer speed is okay, but a firewire was been more user friendly. The last pain is the price. For a simple OS, A USB connection and a 6GB notebook HD it is pretty expansive. Enough with the negative comments. 6GB HD space is more than enough capacity for music. The size of the device is also nice (Like a Compact CD player) And it is a beautey. Great design. Another point that I would notice is the configuration. - A manual (not 'bass' and 'extra bass') equelizer. - the playlist editor. - the amount of information. The firmare update for more support/userfriendlyness (and maybe a better font in the future) FINAL CONCLUSION : This baby is many times better than any other &lt;128MB mp3 player. Concider the bad points, and make your own choice. I am more than happy with it.
B000026D6I,5.0,After returning three similar units made by Archos, I've found the Nomad to be a far superior product. My Archos units always broke down after 4-6 weeks (no unusual wear, they would just stop powering up all together even with new batteries). Both units had their pros with regard to functionality. However, the Nomad is more reliable and I can always count on it to work and to work the same way every time without constant glitches like the Archos.
B000026D6I,5.0,Forget about memory card-dependent MP3 players. This is a new generation, a quantum leap forward at a very reasonable price (more reasonable than you might think, as no expensive memory cards are needed). It will hold *ALL* your music, not only in MP3 format, but in WMA format (this compression tech is superior to MP3 and will supplant it) as well. Downloading from your PC is a breeze with the USB connection, and the unit's controls make individual song search &amp; access fairly simple. The size is fine (though clearly the Diamond Rio, et al, is a smaller pkg), about what a portable (Walkman-style) CD player measures. Battery life is okay (rechargeable) and it will run endlessly on 12V or AC power. The headphones are just marginal. Its one drawback is its moderate volume on playback; if you want to really hear the music on the subway, it may not rock your world.
B000026D6I,5.0,If you love music , and you love to hear music the whole day, well you can  1) Get a Pick Up and use it to carry all yours CD from place to place 2)  Buy a Nomad Jukebox. With 6 gb to store music you can carry a looooot of  music and with a good quality, more than 1000 songs, you will be hearing  music the whole day, ( 24 hours a day , and U won't listen all of it), so  it have a lot of space, a nice design and it is from creative. Well as soon  as i pay some bills, i will sell my poor Nomad and get one of these  mounstrous Jukebox.
B000026D6I,5.0,I just couldn't wait to buy this mp3 player. I kept debating because it is so expensive, but some things are worth paying for. I am impressed on how many songs can be stored on the hard drive. The jukebox comes with a lot of songs on it already and there's still 4gb's of space. One thing I would like to see on the software updates:* Make the transfer button enabled so you can transfer songs from the jukebox to your computer. It is only one way right now.
B000026D6I,5.0,Most reviews for the Nomad Jukebox praise the device itself.  I can't argue -- it's the best MP3 player ever. But what makes this MP3 player stand above the rest is the software that comes with it.  &quot;Play Center 2&quot; is by far the easiest and most effective way to create MP3's from your CD collection.  I got the Nomad on Friday, and by Saturday morning, I have 50 hours of music ready to go.  It's all properly indexed by Artist, Album, Genre and Playlist.  This software has made creating MP3's as easy as point and click.
B000026D6I,3.0,I anxiously waited for this product to come out and as much as I wanted to love it, I just couldn't get past the three major flaws I've listed below. I wanted an MP3 player that would hold a lot of music so I wouldn't have to keep running to my computer to transfer in new music every time I wanted to listen to something different. This unit does do that, but you pay a price for it. (1) The unit is awkwardly shaped, heavy, and rather bulky. I thought I could get used to this by telling myself that the unit would be like holding a portable CD player. Wrong! It weighs nearly a pound! What's worse is that this units shape makes it feel a little awkward to try to carry it in your hand. I always feel like I'm going to drop it because of it's weird, hard to grip oval shape covered with a slippery plastic case. I just don't enjoy walking around with this large heavy thing in my hand. (2) The battery life is one of its biggest drawbacks. You only get 3-4 hours of usage from a single charge! Talk about stressful! When I'm away from home I'm constantly worried it's going to die after running out of juice again and it leaves me searching for a place to charge it wherever I go. Making sure you always have extra charged batteries with you at all times just adds to the stress! I can't tell you how many times this thing has gone dead on me when I've been out and about. Listening to a portable music player should be fun and a relatively carefree process, and this thing just does not give me that kind of an experience. (3) It takes forever for this player to boot up and load the music! You have to sit and wait a couple minutes during this process before you can start doing anything with it! This is a real drawback if you are the type of person who would be turning it on and off through out the day to listen to a few tunes when you have a little bit of time on the go, like on your lunch break, in between classes or meetings, out doing quick errands, or using it in your car for numerous but short trip where you would have to shut it off upon arrival. This problem simply makes me not want to use this unit when I normally would with a standard MP3 player. I end up just leaving it my bag most the time if I know I'm not going to have a lot of time to listen to it, and with the size and weight issue I don't really enjoy hauling it around in my bag either since I already have enough to carry as it is. ***Basically, this unit was designed to be a stand alone MP3 player plugged into a wall with speakers plugged into it, NOT as a portable &quot;on the go&quot; music player -the unit is just too much of a hassle for it to be truly portable.
B000026D6I,4.0,A super player with great sound, a lot of storage capability.It's perfect if you are a purist about sound:I compress MP3 at 224 KBPS to ensure the best quality at a reasonable file sizes.But not everything's perfect:You now have a super player with lots of CD's that you have easily transferred to it but the batteries that you've charged for 12 hours won't last more than 3 or 4 hours.So, if you're looking for a portable player, mmm!:it weights a lot and it eates batteries quickly.It's better to use it &quot;plugged&quot;.I'm thinking of buying a smaller player for daily use and keeping this one at home with the best of my CD's into it.Resuming:Short batteries life, high-weighted but excellent sound reproduction and extras like reverb, parametric EQ and good headphones.And, what a price!
B000026D6I,3.0,I just got the nomad and i do like it but i had bought it for a protable mp3 player and it dosent live up to the word portable at all.  I cant seem to get it to play for more that an hour and a half.  (wow i have hours upon hours of music but i cant listen to it anyway) I also can not get my player to work with normal batteries. It says in the manual that it will work with alkaline batteries also but i havea no go here.  I cant get the player to event turn on with alkaline batteries in it.  So to finish this is a wonderful product if u never leave home but ya know at home you also have a computer.
B000026D6I,4.0,To Tyler Ude (an Amazon reviewer) and others who have bought this Nomad and experienced a freeze-up (lock-up): Before you return this product, try pushing the reset button at the bottom of the player.  This should reboot the system without losing data and un-freeze the machine.  Because Nomad runs on a large hard drive with a buggy operating system, freeze-ups will often happen (like a computer).  Even if there's a new and improved operating sys. freeze-ups are inevitable.  So, just get used to pressing that little reset button.
B000026D6I,4.0,I have had my Jukebox for about 2 months now and there are some great things about this unit but also some serious deficiencies, esp. for those planning to use the unit on long airplane flights or who otherwise need long battery life.  Most of these drawbacks have been noted by other reviewers, but a couple of them really need to be carefully considered by any prospective purchaser.Positives are many and widely noted already.  Capacity is very good a 6GB - but by no means limitless as some reviews claim.  If you are a big music buff who likes a lot of variety in the music at hand, you can fill this baby up as I have.  However, it beats every other alternative I've found and sure beats carrying 30 or 40 CDs on every business trip.  Sound is good.  Latest firmware upgrade solves a number of niggling ease-of-use issues.There are really only a couple of negatives, but they may be severe depending on what's driving your purchase.  First, assume you will need to pitch the headphones that come with the unit and replace them with something else.  Personally, I've used it with both Sony and Bose noise cancelling headphones and either, esp. the Bose, works great in combo with the Jukebox.  If you are an airplane traveller, this is the way to go.However, if you are an airplane listener, you run into the big drawback on this unit way too fast - battery life is ridiculously low.  I do a lot of transcontinental flying and go from LA to Europe about once a month.  My original reason for getting the unit was to save carrying CD player plus 2 or 3 dozen CDs all over Europe just for those 10 to 12 hour flights.  But even with two sets of the rechargable batteries, I can't even get half-way to Europe.  So I've really been unable to satisfy my original purpose in buying the unit.  It has been great in my office, where I can plug it in to electricity, playing out through a Bose Wave Radio and its fine on shorter flights.Overall a super device except for the crippling short life of its batteries.  Now, if I can only find an airplance seat power converter that will work for my laptop and the Jukebox!
B000026D6I,5.0,You already know that it holds a ton of music, is easy to navigate, and overall a great mp3 player.  There are two main complaints posted at Amazon.The first is the low battery life.  That is true.  You can get somewhere around 4 hours.  Keep in mind it comes with two sets of batteries, so if you carry both around you have  about 8 hours.  The reason for the low battery life is that you are running a hard drive!  If you mainly use this kind of thing at the home or in the car, there is a AC adapter and I believe Creative has just released a car kit.Another complaint is the loudness.  While it is not near soft, it is not quite as loud as a CD player usually achieves.  For me, however, it is usually not a problem.  I have found that the SoundJam program (comes with the player) lets you raise the sound of any track when you rip the CD's to mp3.Here is one great part about the Jukebox - free upgrades from the website!  In the first upgrade they added the ability to search in a track.  What they add later depends on the input given to them by customers.Overall, this is a great player if you can shell out the . . . the cash. . .  6 gigs of music will support almost all musicfans. I encourage everyone interested to check out the official website: [...]
B000026D6I,2.0,The Nomad Jukebox is SDMI compliant. That is a bad thing, because it means that MP3s uploaded onto the player cannot be downloaded back to your computer. I think once people realize this MAJOR flaw, the returns will flood in. Hopefully next time around, creative will pay more attention to the needs of its customers instead of the industry. Download capability, more battery life, forward/&quot;rewind&quot; capability, plug-ins (I cant listen to mp3s without the winamp fader plug in), these are not too much to ask for a ... player.  If you need a multi-gig player today, you don't have a choice besides the big, flawed Jukebox. I for one will wait for the avalanche of multi-gig players just around the corner...
B000026D6I,1.0,First off when you call with a problem with a product you have only had two days and you know more about it than the Tech Support people, you can definitely count on bad times. I had my &quot;dream machine&quot; for less than 2 days when it totally locked up. It sat and tried to start up and that was it. When I called the support line I got some fool who told me I needed the firmware upgrade. I informed him I had already downloaded the upgrade and that is when my problems began. His solution? Run it again! I then asked him how I could do that when the machine is totally locked up and unable to connect to my pc via the usb port. His answer? Send it back it had a bad reaction to the firmware upgrade. They would then send me a refurb. No thanks. I returned it and am still waiting for a refund from Amazon. I hope I don't get a hassle from them too. This is Creative Labs people not some start up with no idea of what good workmanship and tech support should be. I am thoroughly disappointed and not going to ever throw money their way again. Buyer beware bad work and idiot tech support buy at you own risk!
B000026D6I,4.0,I'm just throwing my $0.02 in here. I have been wanting an MP3 player for awhile now. When I went to buy, it was total impulse, money to burn, buy it. I took a chance on the Nomad because of size alone. Don't kid yourself, size is everything. When it comes to MP3 files, most companies out there don't seem to get the fact that anyone interested in MP3's need a LOT of space. This puppy has it. My entire collection is only 4 gigs, and I have a LOT of music.The sound is a little light. I bought better headphones than the ones included (didn't like the fit of those anyway) and now have a classic over the head set that is fine. Still could be louder, but as it is, people sitting next to me on the train can hear what I am listening to. So it plays fine.The error handling on the Nomad is a bit weak. It has no way to deal with corrupt files, and sometimes I get a load of new music and don't have time to listen to all the tracks and make sure they are full and complete before I am on my way out the door. So I have had to pull the batteries out just to reboot. It will totally freeze up when it hits a bad file. No way around it but to reboot, and the start up time is a bit on the long side.The battery life has been mentioned, but since my biggest use is between the house and the office, I just plug it in when I get to either, and it's ready for the ride back.These are seriously the ONLY complaints I can come up with. I ended up replacing the carry bag with a regular CD Player/CD case with a shoulder strap and enough space to keep the recharge cord with me. It's no havier than a CD player, I don't have to worry about skipping music if I move, and I have my entire music collection on my hip. That makes the good out weight the bad by a long shot. I am a very happy customer.
B000026D6I,3.0,Most of the basics you already know from reading descriptions and reviews of this product. So let me say this: I'm not a volume freak, but this player is simply not loud enough. Full volume is the minimum aceptable setting. For $500 you would expect a device that sounds better than a Rio 500,for example, but that is not the case. The strorage is great, the firmware is being improved and is downloadable, transfer time is very quick. Inital load time (from power on to first sound) is unacceptably slow, but you can live with that. But the volume is a real problem. Creative simply has to do something about that.
B000026D6I,4.0,As soon as I found out Creative is releasing Jukebox, I had to buy it.  I used to have Creative Nomad II.  It was excellent to be honest.  It had FM Radio, Voice recorder and MP3.  As I used it more often, I was frustrated with the memory size and how much memory cost if you want more.  Jukebox.  It's no problem.  Right now, I have 300 individual MP3 songs in there.  It plays great and it sounds even better since this unit includes EAX.  Preset EQ such as Stadium sound, Concert hall, and so on.  Nomad II didn't have this before, so it made a huge difference in listening quality.  I really love this player.  I also found some problems with the player.  It has a better software that handles MP3 Creative PlayCenter 2. But, its interface is a bit ... not intuitive.  There are two screens to juggle.  There is also no way to manage new MP3 songs from the old ones already inside your player.  What I mean is when you only want to add a new song, you either have to remember the new songs or create a new folder and put all the new songs in there.  The other thing is that you can not download songs from the player.  I think you can only upload it if I am correct.(I maybe wrong.)  Jukebox also uses USB to connect to your computer.  It's fast, but occasionally it fails when you try to upload a lot of songs.  It's not that big a problem, but the thing is that you don't know where you were dropped, so you have to figure out what songs were trasferred and not transferred.  Jukebox, by the way,uses its own OS.  When you try to do many things fast, it can crash.  There is a reset button.  It won't erase anything, but you need a very long needle like pin to reset it, but it wasn't supplied by the Creative, so when your jukebox crashes when you are on the road, you better have something sharp.  Otherwise, you won't be able to use it.  OS is also a bit ... again, not intuitive.  It's a bit harder to navigate through the menu, and if you want to erase a song, there is no erase button like Nomad II, but instead, you will have to go through series of menu, then you will have to go back to the playlist to start playing again.  Despite all these things, I still love this machine.  To me, memory count a lot more than some system glitches.  Only thing I hope is a remote.  Possibly wireless remote.  Jukebox has a Infrared interface beside the USB.  So, there is some possibility that Creative will release it.  If you don't carry around the unit often, this will help accessing songs from your couch.
B0000282R9,5.0,If you're looking just for a few hits this would be overkill but a fan will be overjoyed.Just a great set.
B0000282R9,5.0,This is a great collection from Jean Shepard.  All of Jean's fans should have this collection. Great country music.
B0000282R9,5.0,Jean began her recording career in the early fifties and had country hits up to the mid-seventies - not as many or as big as she deserved, but she certainly made her mark. Jean's biggest hits during the period covered by this box of five CD's (up to 1964) included A dear John letter (a #1 duet with Ferlin Husky), Forgive me John (a reply to the previous hit, also with Ferlin), A satisfied mind, Beautiful lies and Second fiddle to an old guitar. All other hits - indeed everything Jean recorded up to the end of 1964 - can also be found here.During this period, Jean was often overshadowed by two other country queens, Kitty and Patsy, but Jean played an important role in gaining recognition for female singers of country music. Jean often sang hard-hitting songs about relationships which would have feminists cheering her on (as Kitty also did, most famously with It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels), a great example being Two whoops and a holler. In this song, Jean demands to know why men can be unfaithful and it's OK, but if a woman does that, she's lower than a hound. Of course, that was the fifties and a few things have changed since then. Jean's feisty side is also evident on several other tracks here.The overall feel of the set is typical fifties honky-tonk country, including cover versions of songs made famous by Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell, Jim Reeves and others - but there are not many songs here which are really famous. I was surprised at just how few such songs Jean recorded during this time.The best known songs here are I can't stop loving you, I love you because, You win again, Mockin' bird hill, If you've got the money I've got the time and I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes (which has the same tune as Wild side of life and It wasn't god who made honky tonk angels), although you will recognise others.Jean has a lovely voice (described by another reviewer as a sweet but full-bodied alto - I can't improve on that), which I find to be much easier on the ear than Kitty's, while her music is much more firmly rooted in country than Patsy's. Jean is truly one of a kind - there will never be another like her.If you are thinking of buying this, you are obviously a huge fan of traditional country music, and you are probably familiar with Jean's music already. If you only want a little of Jean's music, there are other single-CD compilations that will satisfy your needs.
B00002N5QQ,3.0,The pockets are smaller than I would have thought from the picture I seen. I really can't use it at work. May give to someone with petite hands.
B00002N5QQ,4.0,I use this with my clients (children) with Autism so that I can hide items especially my cell phone. I like that I can throw it in the washer. I wish some of the pockets were deeper, but it serves the purpose for why I needed it.
B00002N5QQ,5.0,This is a great &quot;honey do&quot; tool belt!  It has plenty for room for tools that you might need around the house.Seems very sturdy!Enjoy!
B00002N7X0,1.0,The apron bibb ordered was ridiculously small.  Sized for a 3 year old.  The description did not include the size.  I assumed being listed with tools for adults that the apron would be sized for adults.  Customers...don't assume anything!
B00002N7X0,3.0,I thought I was buying a full-sized apron, and could not find dimensions for the item on the website.  The aprons are very short, so not very effective as aprons.  I suppose I was supposed to know that "utility" meant something other than "kitchen."  My bad.  The apron otherwise is of good quality.
B00002N7X0,5.0,I love these things. We use them in our factory everyday. they are light and easy on the neck. just right for screws, bits and small tools etc... highly recommended. last for over a year with normal use.
B00002N7X0,4.0,I like the pockets. Shrinks a lot. Needs ironing every time  you wash. Runs really small for men .. ..
B00002N7X0,4.0,The other reviewers are right, these aprons are on the small side... I took that into consideration when I bought a couple for my kids when they're helping me tool around in the shop.  Had to tie a knot in the neck strap for my 6 year old, but they worked great for them.  So, they work for what I bought them for.
B00002N7X0,4.0,I am of medium height, but this apron perches on the upper half of my chest like a tiny clown bib, leaving the rest of my clothes at the mercy of whatever I'm working on.As bibs go, however, it's nice and sturdy and the pockets are handy.  This would be absolutely perfect as a child's apron.
B000034DKV,5.0,Purchased this hat for my son to use in his school play about insects.  It was perfect.  I dressed him in all black placed the hat atop his head.
B000034DKV,5.0,I needed an ant costume for a play my kindergarden age grandson was in.  I dressed him in red and made wings.  The ant hat was a real winner and parents were very interested in knowing where I purchased it.  It worked out very well, thank you Amazon.
B000034DKV,5.0,My 7yr old has to dress up like a bug for his 1st grade class this spring.  I started to look early for a costume because I knew that would be hard to find.  I thought this hat would be a cute idea!  I'm going to have him wear it with a red shirt and red sweatpants.  He'll be the perfect fire ant!  It fits him perfectly!  It stretched out to fit me too, I'm 37.  I think I"ll go ahead and order the grasshopper hat for my 6yr old to wear for 1st grade next year.
B000034DKV,5.0,I purchased this for my son's bug show. I couldn't find anything like it at local stores. I'm very pleased with the purchase, it's very good quality and well made! Thank you!!
B000034DKV,5.0,This hat is awesome! I can see this hanging in the local library kids room for some reason, lol.. My 14-month old son likes to put on hats and scarfs so I am making him a lil dress up box for role play, and expanding his imagination. This is the best piece he has, great quailty super cute, fits great. Seems like the type of thing that will be around for my grandkids, most def. a keeper! (did buy from a different seller, many different sellers/prices as usual)
B000034DKV,5.0,Bought it for a school play and a year later of my Chihuahua dragging at around it still looks new
B000034DKV,4.0,my son's class wore these in their school play & they were adorable. We haven't done that much with it afterwards but after being tossed around from bin to bin it's still holding up it's shape
B000034DKV,5.0,This hat is strong and looks as cute as in the pictures. We had a small issue with one of the antennae falling sideways but I believe it was due to the kids playing and pulling on the antennae while wearing it. Good fit and adjustable!
B000034DKV,5.0,On time absolutely no problems. It was the head to a Halloween costume. It didn't obstruct his view or anything. It's after Halloween and he still plays with it.
B000034DKX,2.0,It is way too large for a child's head. The blob on top sits on top of the head and has no functional purpose other than to make it top heavy. It seems durable, but it is not attractive. I don't know anything that could be done to it to modify it and make it better.
B000034DKX,5.0,These helmet is a great reasonably peiced accessory to the costume...I love that the face part is open which allows for easy weares...it really pulls the outfit together
B000034DKX,4.0,My son needed to have a science project that preferably included a space suit. This was a very nice addition for that.
B000034DKX,3.0,The soft helmet is of decent quality, and my kids have enjoyed it. Size is about right for my 4-6 year olds; it's pretty tight on my adult noggin! Astronaut is a very healthy thing for kids to play relative to most TV-based dress-up, so I like this product overall.
B000034DKX,5.0,My college age son has this.  He wears it to concerts and parties.  Everyone loves it.  I laugh when I see the photos.
B000034DKX,5.0,I bought this for my nephew who is obsessed with space and being an astronaut. He already had a suit so this accompanied his outfit perfectly.
B000034DKX,2.0,I really wanted this helmet to be a good one. I bought my son an astronaut costume for halloween and needed a helmet. The helmet does not fit a 3 year old, it fits an adult but not a kid. The picture matches the product very well, if you notice in the pic the kids head sits low in comparison to the top of the helmet. The top 4 inches of the helmet is filled with stuffing. I actually took the stuffing out and pop in my childs old bike helmet, i had to do a lot of retro fitting by shaving foam but now the helmet fits and he has a strap to keep it on his head in as well, i bought a blue touch light at home depot for $6 and now it looks really cool with a blue glue over his face. I would have been happier if this went for $10.00 although i would guess the nasa, and american flag patches make it more expensive. I compare the fabricate of this helmet to a cheap stocking you would buy for christmas. There are not many choices for astronaut helmets, so if you choose this one, expect to put some extra work into it.
B000034DKX,5.0,My goddaughters are big into pretend and make-believe, and what better way to create an imaginative world than with dress up and props.  The NASA Astronaut Hats fit perfect, arrived in pristine condition, are super comfortable and are holding up to plenty of use.  The packaging they arrived in was done very well and the items arrived in a timely manner.
B000034DKX,4.0,This was a big hit at my kids school and in the neighborhood out trick or treating. Looks great and we liked that it is soft but the extra padding on top is strange. Also, like any helmet it limits their vision. Toddlers may need some extra guidance. Value exceeds price.
B000034DKX,5.0,My son wanted to be an astronaut for career day.  This helmet was a hit with all the other kids and his teacher.  (He dressed up in a white jogging outfit and this helmet.)
B000034DKX,3.0,i give this product a 3.it was okay but the padding in the top makes it a bit lopsided. if only the padded were adjustable so that it could fit better.
B000034DKX,4.0,My three year old is enjoying the helmet but it seems overly large.  I'm 6' 220 lbs and can wear the hat comfortably, on him its really big.  The microphone boom is not necessary and is an annoyance.  We cut it out with a seam ripper and it worked well.  Visibility is good with the hemet and the padding on the top is welcome.In short it's fun, but the educational value eludes me.
B000034DKX,3.0,I ordered this for a child who loves astronauts and costumes.  Unfortunately, this was not a hit with her - probably because of the strange shape.  The padding on the top keeps it from sitting level on her head.  The window cut in the front is also too large, and I had to cut off the &#34;microphone&#34; attachment from the inside of the helmet to even get her to wear it a few minutes.
B000034DKX,5.0,My 3 year old son is so into space and astronaut. He is not used to it yet. It fetes him perfect but scared to put it on. I think he needs more time and get use to it. But it came just the way it looks.
B000034DKX,5.0,My grandson loves it! He is able to wear it and use his telescope at the same time. Comfy and roomy!
B000034DKX,4.0,My 2 year old lved this the second I took it out of the box. He wanted to wear it all of the time...even in the car. Great product, comfortable and cute.
B000034DKX,5.0,I was on the hunt for an astronaut helmet that wasn't closed in and that was comfortable for my son.  He loves this!  It made his costume complete.  Its funny because the top part of this soft helmet is tall, so they truly look like an astronaut.  They do get a little hot in it, and the cloth mouthpiece sometimes is bothersome.  Overall though, this was a hit with my preschooler and a hit with me.
B000034DKX,5.0,I am an adult and I bought this helmet because I just feel like it's the perfect accessory for every day life. There was a lot of stuffing in the top of the helmet but I just cut a small hole from the inside and pulled it out and now it fits perfectly. This helmet is definitely going to be a necessity for Miami Music Week.
B000034DKX,4.0,Bought it as a gift for a 9-year old and they loved it.  Quality construction and room to grow.  I even managed to get it over my adult head.  It was a bit tight, but a good test for the strength of the material and stitching.
B000034DKX,4.0,Kids had fun with the astronaut hat, made for a great photo op at the party.  Fit well on different aged children at the party.
B000034DKX,3.0,This hat is nice, especially with the pretend mic. But I think the top is too bulky and could have less padding. The bulk makes it look a little awkward. I will try to take out some of the stuffing. But I know the kids will have fun with it either way!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Grandboy was so happy when he opened this. I love that the hat has an adjustable band in it. Good quality made product.Grandboy is hiding everything in that hat!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Bought this for my son and he LOVES it. Its comfortable, adjustable to different head sizes, creative and excellent quality. I balked at the price but it's worth every penny. Stands up to rough use. I only wish the huge white &#34;adjustable&#34; tag inside was black. Other than that....completely recommend.
B000034DKZ,5.0,6 year old grand son loves it. When he nis happy I am happy.  Hat has good appearance and is made well.
B000034DKZ,5.0,Bought for my neighbors  7yo child who loved it and preceeded to learn magic tricks as a result. Really adorable
B000034DKZ,5.0,What a wonderful toy. It is easy to manipulate and no other complicated directions are needed.My son who is six can make magic happen with this hat. He can make anything small dissapear and show up again easily. My daughter age four easily makes things go away and come back with this hat.The hidden pocket is impossible to see unless you stick your head in the hat yet it is very easy to feel with your hands. Adults can easily put their hand in this hat's secret hole as can little children. It is well made and has put up with lots of use and wear.This is a fun toy. It is well worth the money.Enjoy.
B000034DKZ,5.0,We purchased this for our 5 year old aspiring magician.  It is really nicely made, comfortable to wear, and very easy to hide things in.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to complete a magician's outfit with a quality hat.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My daughter loves her magic hat.  You can also use other items and not just the bunny, which is great and keeps your children's magic shows fresh and their imaginations working.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My 4 year old nephew's new phase has been magic. Of course he needed a hat! I live overseas, and had to hope for the best when I shipped this to his house. I called to check on his response and he was more than thrilled. He said it fits him perfectly, and thinks its cool he could rest his magic bunny on his hat to take with him too. This was a successful blind buy. I still haven't seen it yet, but as long as the kid is happy-- I'm happy! It's a great confidence builder for any magician!
B000034DKZ,1.0,The hat is too small for my four years old and it is not that great. My son tried it for five minutes and then let it down.
B000034DKZ,4.0,I was happy that he hat did adjust with an elastic band around the head and my 3 year old could wear the hat with a good fit. However an adult could fit the hat to when the elastic is adjusted. When the hat is adjusted for a young child it looks mad hatterish as the top of the hat is still adult size. I did not realize from the photo how oversized the top of the hat would be. Great trick and easy for the kids to do. I would still recommend. Material is a shiny velour (thin velvet) type material.
B000034DKZ,5.0,Perfect Birthday Gift for my five year old grandson who is very into magic these days! This along with the Cape sold with another hat and he created &#34;Xavier the Magnificent.&#34;
B000034DKZ,4.0,This was a fantastic buy. I searched extensively for the right top hat and decided on this one.  I removed the rabbit and decorated it in a Disney Cars theme using velcro to hold stuff on for my son's 4th birthday and it looked great. Fit his head perfectly and a year later it's still in great condition and ready for a new theme.  Maybe we'll actually use it as a magician hat next time...
B000034DKZ,5.0,My 2 year old loved his magician's hat.  We received it just as we walked out of the door for Halloween.  It is really easy for him to pull the rabbit out and he was so proud of himself.  Ta-da!
B000034DKZ,5.0,So cute.  Bought for Halloween, but my two-year-old plays with it all the time.  The hat looks a bit &#34;goofy&#34; on him since it is so big, but it is cute.  He can even use it for magic tricks.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My daughter loves anything magic and wants to be a magician when she grows up - she is only 4 right now. This hat is perfect for a young child to play with. They love the rabbit and the fact that they can put another small toy in there too.Highly recommended for the under 10's who want to do a simple trick and good quality too!
B000034DKZ,5.0,my 3 year old is obsessed with Daniel Tiger and there is an episode where they have a character do magic and pull something out of his hat.  She has a ton of fun with this hat.  The adjustable feature really works and it fits her head well with the straps pulled in.  The hidden compartment is awesome.  She can entertain herself and us for awhile putting things in the hat and pulling them out.
B000034DKZ,5.0,We recently received this hat and played with it right away.  Hiding the rabbit in the hat is so much better than with the hard plastic magic hat we own currently.  That one has a trap door.  Plus the plastic one doesn't fit on anyones head, so it falls off quickly.This hat has an adjustable strap to fit many different head sizes.  The bunny velcros onto the hat.  We bought it for halloween :)
B000034DKZ,5.0,My granddaughter has been using a cowboy hat and pretended it was a magician hat. I searched on Amazon and this fit perfectly!
B000034DKZ,4.0,Great item.  My 5 year old is thrilled w/ this hat.  Very easy to use.
B000034DKZ,5.0,I bought this for my grandson and he dressed up with the cape I also got. He added his own touches it was adorable
B000034DKZ,5.0,I actually purchased this for myself.  We have a talent show at work every year and this would be a great addition to my magic show.  It is very cute.  Love!
B000034DKZ,5.0,My 3 year-old had a magician come to his preschool and since then, loves to play magician.  I bought this for Christmas not too sure what I would get.  It's beautiful.  It's nicely sewn with soft black velour.  The little rabbit is nice quality as well and the 'magic' pouch he goes into is easy to access and I'm sure my son will have no problem manipulating it.  You are also able to adjust the size to fit your kids head.  A great find and I can't wait to see his face Christmas morning!  You won't be disappointed.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My 3 year old grandson really has fun with his magic hat.  The size is adjustable and both the hat and rabbit are well made.  I was really surprised at the high quality of the hat for the price.  Amazon packed the order properly and shipped it promptly
B000034DKZ,5.0,i bought this for my 6 year old daughter who is very into magic. she loves it! excellent quality and really cute! great addition to a magic set!
B000034DKZ,5.0,this is an extremely deep hat that can hold many different items you cannot see the hidden pocek in the bottom and it has a nice rich velour covering
B000034DKZ,5.0,I purchased this hat for my soon to be 8 year old son. He is on the larger size, and I kept debating whether or not to purchse the adult size or child's size...I read the reviews and descriptions and decided to gamble on the child size. It fits fine. Not tight at all. The hat is well made. The rabbit is simply adorable. Hat has a secret compartment to hide the rabbit too:)Reasonable price and very happy with this purchase.
B000034DKZ,4.0,I purchased this for my 6 year old son.  He is very tall for his age...a big kid, but this hat looked really large on him.  (A positive, there is an adjustable piece inside to make the hat smaller to fit head sizes.)  It's also slightly oddly shaped.  Rather reminiscent of the Mad Hatter rather than a top-hat magician's-style.  Still, the product worked well for our purposes and was a hit with my son and anyone he performed the 'appearing rabbit' trick for.  The satin band around the hat was only attached in one place, so very loose, but I superglued it into place and that worked fine.  All in all, a little big and funny looking, but good quality and a hit with my son. Worth the money.
B000034DKZ,4.0,My kids love this Magician's Hat, and it goes nicely in our costume box to prevent cluttering our house any more... and they get it out for new friends or new visitors.  This is a really nice buy because it's not going to break, it has the magic element of surprise and makes your kids feel clever!  Kudos to the old Magic Hat with Rabbit trick!
B000034DKZ,5.0,bought this for my 6 yr old to wear for a school performance (couldnt find a top hat in time) he loves it and so do his younger brothers. hidden pocket for the rabbit to dissappear. so cute!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Having recently seen a magic show and watched an older friend do tricks, my 4 1/2 year old son expressed a strong interest in doing "magic" and he wanted a magic kit.  Unfortunately, he didn't completely understand that the "magic" he'd observed was illusion rather than the real deal.  I searched for tricks he could perform that would be simple enough for him to learn and also have a "wow" factor for his audience of preschool and kindergarten friends.  This hat, with its included hidden rabbit, exactly fits the bill.  He LOVES it.  Not only does he make the rabbit disappear and reappear, but he also does magic with lots of little things around the house (matchbox cars, legos, etc. disappear and reappear).  The hat itself is sturdy and well-made with an adjustable band inside to accommodate various head sizes.  Magic aside, the hat also serves as a wonderful "dress-up" accessory.  Can't say enough about this toy. Highly recommend it!
B000034DKZ,4.0,Niece used as part of Halloween costume and sparked interest in magic! Holds many&#34;rabbits&#34;. Very Well made and adjustable size! Worth money!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Great starter magic toy for my 4.5 son. My son and his twin sister loved showing each other the disappearing and reappearing rabbit. Gets kids playing for hours. Such a confidence builder. I highly recommend it if your child is interested in magic. I bought it in combination with the "My First Magic Set".
B000034DKZ,5.0,My 9 year old daughter got this for her birthday, and we are very pleased with it!  It is good quality. She was able to do the rabbit out of a hat trick easily for her friends!
B000034DKZ,5.0,This hat is absolutely adorable.  Sooo cute while performing tricks.  My grand child loves the bunny that comes with it.  I highly recommend it.
B000034DKZ,5.0,This is a very sturdy and convincing magic hat.  We bought it for a 5 year old's birthday.  She comes out with the hat on her head and pretends the rabbit is not there.  We yell there is a rabbit on your head.  HUH?  From there she must make it disappear and we beg her to make it appear again.  Really sparks the imagination and brings out the showman in a child.
B000034DKZ,4.0,Kids will have fun with it.  Works well for our needs.  Appreciate the other reviews that were encouraging as well.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My granddaughter is loving this and learning all the magic tricks.  Well worth the price. The shipment was very fast and the purchase was easy.
B000034DKZ,4.0,I ordered this hat for my 3 1/2 yr old son for their school Halloween party/parade.  I was so glad I went with this costume as he were the only one wearing it!  It was something convenient for him to put on and take off by himself while in class.  The other great thing is that a few days later, I was able to wear it as well for my own Halloween gathering!  This hat is well built and I can see it lasting for years and years to come.  It's great that there's an elastic inside that makes it adjustable and the bunny is indeed a cute addition and gives it more character!  It may be pricier than other magician hats out there but in my opinion, it was worth the extra money given the quality of this product.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My Grandson loves it! So much fun to pull a rabbit out of your hat!!!I recommend this product if you want to laugh and have fun !
B000034DKZ,4.0,Who decided a company making kid's toys should be called Elope? Anyway, it's cute and pretty well made. My daughter looks adorable in it which inspires me to continue to look amazed even after viewing the same trick 37 times in a row.
B000034DKZ,5.0,Our young magician was impressed and we were taken Wyeth the appearance of the rabbit -a must have or all young magicians
B000034DKZ,3.0,Gift was liked. Would like more majic items to go with the cape set. That way he can play with it more.
B000034DKZ,5.0,It is great so plush.  My grandson took it out and said A MAGIC HAT YA He loved it.  well worth the money.
B000034DKZ,4.0,I really liked the magic hat ,very good quality and I'm sure my grandson Nathan with have hours of magic fun.
B000034DKZ,4.0,My stepson really likes this hat and it's the only "trick" out of the magic set we got him that he really gets. He's only 4 so we didn't expect anything different. We also expected this hat to be big for him (although he does have a big head), but it is REALLY big. And on the hat or packaging itself it doesn't say anything about kids, but it seems to be an adult sized hat? Still fun and he can kind of wear it if he pushes it back a bit. Not sure if it's necessarily worth the money...but still a good purchase since he's definitely having fun with it!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Love this almost as much as my little one did.  It is well made and easy to use.  It allows her to show off at the drop of a hat and she is way cute using it.  Best gift ever!  So even if your child doesn't like magic, get it they will have a blast amazing their friends and Grandparents
B000034DKZ,5.0,My daughter received this for Christmas.  At 5 years old, she is very interested in magic this year.  This did not disappoint.  The bunny is removable and attaches to the hat with velcro.  There is a hidden section at the base of the hat where you can hide the bunny, magic scarves, etc...  That hat itself is soft and plush...but very durable....my 20 month old son has played with it and withstands the abuse.  Great purchase!!!
B000034DKZ,5.0,My grand daughter wanted a magician set for her birthday, and we got her this to go with it.  She was absolutely thrilled!!
B000034DKZ,5.0,I bought this magician's hat as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old son because I thought he would love learning about magic and how to do magic tricks. We have all been very impressed with the hat and how it works. It has sparked an interest in magic for him and the entire family.  The hat itself is not like a traditional magician's hat because it is made of velvet and a little flimsy, but your first-time magician should really enjoy it. Also, I ordered this product during the holiday and it came very quickly. Thank you Amazon for great service!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Gave this present to a little girl around the age of five or six. She was delighted! The guilty pleasures of making a child believe in magic is great. I thought the one size would be a problem even if it has a &#34;strap&#34;, she is a very young girl, after all. Quite the contrary, it was big, but it only made her look that much more adorable with it. The one con that I see and I won&#8217;t penalize it by removing a star, because it has easy workarounds, is the lack of Velcro, button, zipper, pin, or anything to keep the hidden compartment closed. The bunny could accidentally fall out if you put the hat upright . All-in-all it was a good purchase. Easily storable by putting something flat on top of it to fold down.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My son got this to accompany his magician outfit for Halloween.  He absolutely loved the hat.  He wore it constantly and loved performing his &#34;trick&#34; of making the rabbit appear.  From the mom perspective, he looked adorable with it on in his costume.  I highly recommend this for any child interested in magic.
B000034DKZ,5.0,Purchased for my 4 1/2 year old grandson.  He is a lover of hats and this one took the cake!  He loved showing off his new magical ability.
B000034DKZ,5.0,I purchased this hat to transform into a Stevie Nicksesque style for my daughter's Halloween costume.  It was fantastic and she loves playing with it now as a Magician's Hat. Great quality and value.
B000034DKZ,5.0,Very well made. Adds the perfect touch to a young one's magician costume. Sit well on my 5 year old's head (and he has a relatively large head).Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.
B000034DKZ,5.0,This hat is made of good quality, sturdy and durable for a 3 yo to bring to preschool, wear it all day, and have it still be in perfect shape for Halloween and after. The bunny is an awesome touch with it being able to be velcroed (sp?) to the tip of the hat and the best part was hiding the bunny in the hat.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My daughter loves this hat.  No one can figure out where the rabbit comes from.  She puts other items in it and pulls all kinds of things from her magic hat.  She even wears it when she is not a magician.
B000034DKZ,5.0,ordered this for my daughter's 9 year old magic birthday party.  She loves it and we used it for a scarf trick too.
B000034DKZ,4.0,It is more than I expected. There is a secret compartment to hide the rabbit. My 7 year old nephew is a comedian and loves telling jokes and doing tricks. This is probably one of his favorite things right now
B000034DKZ,5.0,This is a really cute magician hat with a hiding spot for the rabbit or other items your child wishes to hide. It is also well made and not cheesy!
B000034DKZ,5.0,This is so cute.  My 9 year old boy plays with it often.  I thought it would be too heavy to stay on his head with the rabbit in it but it is not.  It's very cute and well worth the $ for a kid to use his imagination.
B000034DKZ,5.0,I bought this after reading the reviews and both of my kids 3 and 5 love it.  I paired it with a magic wand and they have so much fun with it.  They not only pull the rabbit out, but also any toy that will fit and it is like a new trick every time.  The hat itself is puffy and large and looks super cute on the kids.
B000034DKZ,5.0,This was part of a Halloween costume for us (a "hobgoblin" hat!), but it has also become a treasured toy for my son who is six years old. He is learning some simple magic tricks and practices almost every day.  This toy is simple, soft, yet realistic and definitely makes him feel like a grown-up.  I thought he might be a little too  old for it, but it is just right for him.  (The other reviews here were mostly for younger children.)
B000034DKZ,5.0,My granddaughter loved it.  She already had a flower magic trick and this added to it - the hat and then the extra trick
B000034DKZ,5.0,My 3 year old daughter looooves this hat. It's really well made. Is adjustable to fit, and the rabbit it adorable. The best part is you can put any other small item inside the secret compartment and make it &#34;disappear&#34;.  Highly recommend. I think this hat is good for any age 3 and up.... My hubby and I included ;)
B000034DKZ,5.0,Both our 4 and 6 Year old grandsons loved this hat and the rabbit trick.  It fit well and was a hit.
B000034DKZ,5.0,The hat  is well constructed.  It has adjustable sizing and it was definitely need for our six year old grandson.  The &#34;rabbit in the hat&#34; is a  fun trick!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Great toy for my Grandaughter simple easy to use,rabbit is a cute addition,verySimple instructions for child to play with as soon as it's opened
B000034DKZ,5.0,I bought this for my 4-year-old son and he is thrilled with it.  The hat is very well made... soft and sturdy, so it's comfortable on his head and doesn't lose its shape.He doesn't seem to tire of showing off his magician skills, and he has already experimented with putting different things in the hat to make them appear and disappear.This is one of those simple toys that allows kids to really use their imagination.  Best of all, no tiny little parts to lose.  Even if the rabbit gets misplaced, kids can still use any small toy in the hat.
B000034DKZ,5.0,We used and re-used it many times. nicely done. Easy to use, excellent quality.We love it! You can also add other things to take out of the hat. There is enough room for a few more items.
B000034DKZ,5.0,This was for our grand son. Everybody enjoyed the shows he put on with it. The rabbit was a nice touch.
B000034DKZ,5.0,I bought this hat for my grandchildren..using them for Easter baskets..I love the hat,reminds me of the Mad Hatter hat from Alice in Wonderland..very well made,soft and sturdy..the rabbit is very cute and sticks on with velcro..highly recommend this hat,I know my grandchildren will love it,I can't wait for Easter..so excited!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Bought this Kid's Magician Hat with Rabbit for my grandson who is 3 years old.  He LOVED it.  We also gave him a Melissa and Doug magic flower pot to go with it.  Great hit, even though the suggested age was much older, he plays with this every day.
B000034DKZ,4.0,The price is good. The hat is well made out of nice strong velvet, with 1 exception: the silk hatband is only tacked down in a few spots and starts to 'float' up the hat. I had to sew it into place, (thus 4 stars instead of 5). The 'magic' part of the hat is well hidden but only took my 10 year old a few minutes to get competent. He even uses it (for very short periods of time) to pull one of our live chinchilla's out.I like that it stands up nicely and doesn't crumple down into a flat hat. Great for your budding magician. Or your child who is into dressing well - or just likes hats. This is a wise choice for your $$.
B000034DKZ,5.0,My grandson  loves magic.  the magic kit I bought for him had a cheap hat and a paper bunny.  I had to upgrade and so glad I did.  This is so much better.
B000034DKZ,4.0,My son who id 7 wore this all Christmas long.  The quality was great.  The bunny on the outside is velcro so it can be taken off and used for magic trick with the hidden pocket inside.  So cute and original. Even the quality of the hat was a nice surprise.
B000034DKZ,5.0,I bought this gift for my sisters toddler and he loved it!! I had read a review and was trying to decide whether it would be worth it or not. Well it was, and I am very happy that I bought him this toy. It was totally worth every cent to see his face light up when I showed him this magic trick for the first time. I showed him the hidden space inside the hat and within about two minutes he was off showing everyone his new magic hat. He told his grandma see theres nothing in there and then waved his hand over the hat and said abera cadabera and pulled out the bunny. He was about 3 1/2 at the time and I was worried that he would be too young for the trick but he wasn't. He is now almost 5 and I just visited him a month ago and he still enjoyed showing me the hat trick. He even loved wearing the hat on his head and he was laughing the the whole time he played with the hat. I think it also helps with abstract thinking and the concept that something is still there even if you can't see it. It also is very impressive to friends when your child (or in my case my nephew) shows them the trick. It is adorable. I am now pregnant and plan to get one for my baby also :)
B000034DKZ,5.0,My seven year old son loves this hat. It goes great with his magic collection. It has a secret compartment to hide a rabbit that comes with the hat. Very cool and lots  of fun !!
B000034DKZ,5.0,This hat is of high quality and is an easy trick for a child to do.  Was not disappointed at all!  Got it for my 3 year old grandson.  Was very happy with the product.
B000034DKZ,5.0,my grandson is 5 just loved this hat good quailty,easy to use looked great in it. was a great xmas gift
B000034DKZ,5.0,This is a great hat.  My 5 yr. old daughter loves it.  The space in the bottom is wonderful for hiding other things too.  I would recommend this magic hat.
B000034DKZ,5.0,I have purchased many hats for my daycare center and some have been of very poor quality. ALL the hats I have purchased thru Elope have been great! I definately will pay a few more dollars for a good product.
B000034DKZ,3.0,I bought this hat for my 8 yr old daughter as she was to be doing a magic show for her school. The hat is HUGE!  It it adjustable to fit, but the actual height of the hat is big for a child.  Not sure I would have purchased it for her had I known.  It does have a hiding spot inside to have a rabbit (included with the hat) &#34;appear&#34;.
B000034DKZ,5.0,this was a gift for my niece and she loved it! She quickly learned how to pull a rabbit from her hat!
B000034DKZ,5.0,Purchased off of grandson's wish list and was very happy when we received it.  Would definitely recommend it for a child who has an interest in performing magic tricks and wants to look like a magician.
B000034DKZ,5.0,I purchased this for my 3 1/2 yr old and 5 1/2 yr old.  They both loved it -- it was very easy to figure out and a great introduction to magic.  It is also a very good quality hat.  We have another hat that came as part of a magic set, and this is far superior to that hat.  I expect it will hold up for a long time.  Great product!
B000034DKZ,5.0,This hat is excellent! It is thick, plush, sturdy, and has a secret pocket for the rabbit and any other &#34;secret&#34; a tot would want to hide!!! It is adjustable and well-made and should last a longggggg time! My grandsons are crazy for hats and this is a winner! I am so pleased with the quality of the hat!!! Awesome!!!
B000034DL1,4.0,For your budding pirate - have fun with this well made item - my son loves it, waving his sword
B000034DL1,5.0,This hat was well worth the money spent.  My son is having a pirate themed birthday party and wanted him to have a different hat to wear from the others since it is his big day.  When we received this I knew straight away this was the one.  He loves it and it fights perfectly.
B000034DL1,5.0,my grandson loves this pirate hat.  will be wearing when he plays in his tree house with other pirate friends
B000034DL1,3.0,needed one for my kid's halloween costum - this was a hat and worked just fine - these postings are dumb
B000034DL1,5.0,I bought this hat for halloween a while back and it was great. I stayed on all evening and it made my outfit look fantastic plus it is comfortable.
B000034DL1,5.0,I bought an Elope kid's pitate hat for my grandson after seeing it in a children's shop. It was so beautifully made, with nice materials, that I ordered a second one for a birthday gift for another little guy. I love this company and their hats!!
B000034DLB,5.0,I bought this hat for my 2 year old daughter.  When I opened the box, I was very suprised to see how big the hat was.  It is adjustable to fit pretty much any size head.  I can wear it, my husband can wear it and well as my daughter.  She loves it. It is very well made and definitely worth the money!!!!
B000034DLC,5.0,My son really likes it. I wish it was a big bigger as his head is on the bigger size. He just turned 5 and fits just right. Material and quality is perfect!
B000034DLC,5.0,I ordered this for my four year old son and it is a perfect fit! The adjustable headband is nearly all the way open for his head. You can make it quite a bit smaller too. This crown is a bit floppier than what the picture makes it out to be. Still, it's a fun little crown.
B000034DLC,4.0,Hat is cute and fuzzy however you need to stuff something in the top to make it stand up or its floppy
B000034DLC,5.0,This was a great product in that you can alter the size of the crown to fit any size head.  It stores well as well.
B000034DLC,3.0,My grandson age 2 going on 3, loves to play characters. So I purchased hive 6 different hats to play with.
B000034DLC,5.0,These hats are beautifully made and very well constructed -- a big step above any other play hats & costumes we've found.There are stores with better selections of these hats, as well as better prices.  Be sure to Google around for the reversible hats by Elope.  Specifically, they make a crown that is nearly identical to this crown (minus the few rhinestones shown on this hat), but it reverses to a frog with tiny crown upon its head!!In our house, hats go a long way toward imaginative play, and with a few accessories (like sword, cape, scarf, wand, etc.), these become our halloween costumes, carnival costumes, and easy-to-pack activities to occupy us while traveling.
B000034DLC,5.0,This hat is great! I wish it came a little larger, but kids loved wearing it and being photo graphed in it.
B000034DLC,5.0,I looked everywhere for a crown that would be awesome for birthdays, and this was the only one that I found even close to what i was looking for the only thing i don't really like is the black poka dots, but overall the crown is adorable.
B000034DLC,5.0,this one has been a winner for both my 3 and 6 year old boys and their girl-friends who come over for playdates. we've had it over over a month, and i expect it to last them a long time. awesome!
B000034DLD,5.0,Bought this for my younger sister and it is a good size for the normal or slightly smaller adult head! :) Nice and colorful, great birthday addition.
B000034DLD,5.0,This was a gift for a 2 year old girl.  Her parents thought it was adorable and couldn't wait to use it.. It is definitly something that can be used for several years instead of landing on the bottom of the toy chest.
B000034DLD,4.0,Got this for my granddaughters birthday a year ago.  She wore it for her third and fourth birthdays.  Still looks good and she loves letting everyone know it is her day,  Disappointed that the candles are sewn on so can't indicate the age of the birthday girl or boy.
B000034DLD,5.0,Everyone loved this hat.  Got for my nephew for his birthday.  So cute for a boy or girl.  Shipping was fast and item seemed really made well.  Adorable!!!
B000034DLD,5.0,Very cute birthday hat!  My daughter loved it and wants to wear it all the time.  It is adjustable so it can be adjusted to fit my daughter but it will also fit me.  I looks really cute in the birthday pictures.
B000034DLD,5.0,We gave this hat as a baby shower gift to a couple who have a unique sense of humor. Since they live several hundred miles from us, we wanted to give something that probably would not be duplicated.  We were right.  The hat was the only one they received.  It was a hit and will continue to be enjoyed by the whole family on their birthdays.
B000034DLD,5.0,Everyone LOVED this hat!  We have a three year old and decided to start a tradition of having a birthday hat.  It fit my head, my husbands(who has a large noggin) and my three year old so we plan on getting lots of use out of it!  Seems well made and sturdy
B000034DLD,5.0,This was a terrific purchase for our 2 year olds birthday.  The hat is absolutely darling.  Our two year old absolutely loves it.
B000034DLD,5.0,This hat is too cute.  It was a big hit this year.  It has:-  an adjustable band inside to fit all ages-  well constructed-  made from good materials-  nice bright colorsI think my daughter will enjoy for years to come!
B000034DLD,3.0,Sadly, did not realize how pink the wrap-around ribbon was on the hat, as well as the rosettes.  Wife had to modify somewhat for grandson's party, not too difficult if you're handy, but at added cost of course.  Would have selected a different product more unisex.
B000034DLD,5.0,My grand children loved this hat. They had fun wearing it on their birthdays. Good, bright colors and the candles stand up well enough.
B000034DLD,2.0,The hat was all crushed and didn't want to stand up like a hat should.  I would not purchase this again
B000034DLD,5.0,I bought 2 of these hats when my oldest daughter was 2yrs and my youngest was 1yr.  They are now 4 and 5.  They look forward to wearing these hats for every birthday celebration.  My oldest recently wore hers out to the grocery store on her birthday.  She received so many compliments and birthday wishes.  The attention just made her day more special. These hats are thick and well made, great colors too, the adjustable velcro band inside the hat is a clever idea for a good fit.  I am purchasing another one to celebrate my 3rd daughter's 1st birthday.
B000034DLD,5.0,I purchased this hat for my 8 year old grandson.  He will be 9 in June so hoping he enjoys it.  I did review another hat more geared to a girl.  We gave it to my grandaughter for her 4th birthday and although it looked really cute on her & fit well, she really didn't like it much.  Waiting to see if the 9 year old will be more impressed.  Either way, I will have gorgeous pictures of the two of them. ;-)
B000034DLD,5.0,The hat was nice enough. It isn't educational, it is just a fun thing for children. My great niece had too many other gifts to open, so the cake hat was not a big deal to her.  My great grandson has one the birthday cake hat since he was 1 year.  He is now 4 and plays with his hat several times a year.(only child)  He will put it on to walk through the house singing Happy Birthday to himself.It is a fun thing for children...since most have everything already...except the Birthday Cake Hat.  :)
B000034DLF,3.0,My daughter loved the way it looked in the picture but the cap was a little limp once it arrived. I think it should have a support in it to keep it on point. We kept it for dress-up but didn't use it for trick or treat... we got a crown instead.
B000034DLF,4.0,It does tend to flop over, but some paper towels have solved the problem.  It has held up to abuse for the last several months.
B000034DLF,4.0,I looked EVERYWHERE for this type of hat.  This one on Amazon is perfect.  My 4 year old granddaughter loves it!  It is a bit floppy after much use but I feel I got my monies worth.
B000034DLF,5.0,I bought this for my little princess, who was having a Royal Ball at school.  She is crazy about all things princess.  The hat is perfect.  It is adjustable, soft, and so cute!  It stands pretty well on its own as long as you round out the top.  It can fall, but just lift it up and round out the crease and it's up again.  My older daughter liked it so much that we bought another one for her, too.
B000034DLF,5.0,I bought two of these cute little hats for my three year old granddaughters to wear with their Princess costumes - what a perfect accessory!  After reading that some had problems with the hat being floppy, I took the plastic the hat was wrapped in stuffed it inside - problem solved!  You won't find anything else like this - just adorable!
B000034DLF,5.0,We got this for our friends daughter who is 3, she loves to play dress-up and has quite a collection of dress-up clothing.  This was perfect for her and she loves it.  A good quality stitching and is very durable, not like a lot of the other dress-up cloths you buy these days.  Well worth the price.
B000034DLF,5.0,Both of the hats that I ordered were in perfect condition. I got the hats on time. My two girls loved the hats.
B000034DLG,5.0,Bought this for my home preschool and well pleased.They are well made- we also purchased the ant and bee one. A big hit at our school! A fun way to teach little ones about insects!
B000034DLG,5.0,I came searching for something for my son to wear in his school play.  This was perfect.  It was the perfect addition to the bug wings we made.  Quality product at a reasonable price.  Saved me from having to search locally for something.
B000034DLG,5.0,Good quality and very cute!  My grandson asked me to dress as a grasshopper for Halloween (he was a spider) so I ordered this hat to complete my costume.  It was great and my grandson loved it.  Now the hat is his for him to enjoy!
B000034DLG,5.0,This hat is nicely made and was comfortable enough my three year old wore it for hours on Halloween.  Sturdy enough to be used for future play.
B000034DLG,5.0,So when my son (1st grade) told me he needed a grasshopper costume for a school play, I had no idea what I was going to do. I saw this hat and paired it with a green sweatsuit.  Perfect!  It was soft, cute, comfortable, and well made.
B000034DLG,3.0,Its a hat our kid wore in a play to be a Grasshopper.  Seems to be built ok. Not much more to say.
B000034DLG,4.0,My son was a praying mantis in a school play.  I had to make his costume and came across this grasshopper hat and decided to use it as it was the closest to a praying mantis I could find.  No one even seemed to notice it was a grasshopper hat and it totally made the costume.  He is in first grade and the hat fit him perfectly and was comfortable for him to wear.  Definitely worth the money.
B000034DLG,5.0,A grasshopper hat is difficult to find! When I found this I bought it because it was the only one I could find. I am SO HAPPY with it. The antenea are strong and stay up! The material is good and the seams did not come apart (like some of my other purchases).
B000034DLG,5.0,my son has to dress up at school for insect day! its absolutely adorable! well made- i cant wait for him to wear it!
B00004NKKE,5.0,I bought this for my son when he was three , he is six now and still loves it! It is pretty loud when it makes the train sound , so buy with that in mind. We haven't had anything break on it and every kid that comes over plays with it so I couldn't be happier with this purchase!
B00004NKKE,5.0,Extra fun because of the choo choo sounds. My great niece and her parents just loved it.  Such a cool vintage toy.
B00004NKKE,5.0,If you never considered getting a top for your child, you should.  I remembered when someone bought one for my son (who is now 21) and he loved it.  Good ones are hard to find.  This is a good one.  I bought two at Christmas and think they are very cool.  My son (age 2 1/2) is very inquisitive and he loves to watch it go.  It has survived his destructive tendancies as well!
B00004NKKE,5.0,Our son received this top from his aunt and uncle for his 2nd birthday and it is the best top I've ever seen and played with!  As others have said, our son isn't quite yet able to push the knob down hard enough to get it to work but he will soon enough.  The sounds it makes are so real and last quite a while.  He likes to lie down on his tummy and watch it although he can't resist and he eventually touches it - the spinning and thus the train stops but the sounds continue!  The train actually goes around inside the clear covering and there are two indicators that react when the train passes through each area which adds to the coolness of this toy!  I was expecting the typical spinning top when we gave that as an idea for a gift but this surpasses that by landslides!  It's great!
B00004NKKE,3.0,Our grandchildren have always enjoyed this top but, like all the other reviews, a grown-up must be there to push down on it 20 times to get it to go.  I think the most disappointing thing about the top is that the little red plastic base SPLIT apartso now it falls over as it slows down and immediately stops the train from moving around the track.  If only they had made it with a more durable base like, metal, that would have been so much better. If they had to use plastic, then they shouldre-design it with a heavier plastic so it won't split.
B00004NKKE,4.0,I really wanted a top that you could spin and as it slowed down, it would topple and fall.  At first my grandson, who is 2, was not the slightest bit interested in it.  In fact the noise scared him.  But little by little, he came around and even tried to push the handle down. Eventually he shouted do it again over and over.  I guess that the toys of old have been upgraded, but as long as he's happy, I'm happy.  The good thing about this toy is it teaches hand coordination and works their little muscles.  The bright colors are also an asset.
B00004NKKE,5.0,If I'd had one of these tops when I was a kid, I would've played with it and stared at it for hours, daydreaming about what was going on in the picture the train travels through.  The second I took the toy out of the box and tried it out, my two-year-old son came running to see what was making the train sound.  We were both delighted and spent ages playing with the top together.  It's amazing to see the train make the signals react.  It is a little hard for my son to push hard enough to make the train go and the sound start up, but I'm sure it'll be easier as he gets older.The base of the top did turn inside out once when my husband pushed too hard on it sideways, but that problem was easily remedied; we just turned the right side out again.Seriously, this top is amazing.  It's hard to convey that without video, but it's worth seeing in person!
B00004NKKE,5.0,I bought it for my then 15 months old son and he loved it. He loves trains so it was a great buy. He still plays with it almost every day.
B00004NKKE,2.0,An OK toy, but interest in it wore off fast.  I think a regular top would hold interest longer.
B00004NKKE,1.0,I was very disappointed. My mother had a top similar to this as a child. We purchased this one and it did not live up to expectations. The top has to be pushed down very hard and fast for the train to make noise. It is difficult for small children and the fun fades very quick. It is a toy that will be used once or twice and then discarded.
B00004NKKE,5.0,I used to have one of these when I was a kid. I had forgotten all about it until I saw it on here. One of my favorite toys. Great for any kid who likes trains!
B00004NKKE,1.0,I bought this top for my 2 year old after reading reviews and seeing people thought this one was ok.  I am here to tell you it's not.  This top has nothing of interest except the train and you have to pump this about 30 times just to get the train to go half way around the track.  How many toddlers do you know with that kind of patience for a minimal reward?  The clear dome spins but what's the point if you can't really see it?  The train sounds are ok but there are plenty other toys out there that make train sounds.  If I had actually seen this in person in a store I never would have purchased it.  This is going back ASAP and maybe I will try a choral top.  Then again, maybe not.......
B00004NKKE,5.0,My 2 1/2 year old boy loves trains, so it was an easy decision to get him this.  I don't have any complains for now.Well is 2012 and the spinner is still going, we love it!
B00004R904,5.0,I loved this hat!It was constructed well, and it looks fantastic!I bought this for my girlfriend who is a true gourmet cook, it was perfect.
B00004R904,5.0,Okay, so i got this hat as a joke!  But its really fun to wear cooking and really adds those finishing touches to the 'facade' you want to put on as a 'professional' cook.  or heck, maybe you are a professional cook and this just tops it all off!  Easy to wash also!
B00004SQLQ,5.0,Traveling through South America in bus and train stations people crowd you. You get warned over and over again to carry your backpack in front. I got tired of that so I got these. They were easy to set and probably aren't *that* tough, but it would be difficult for a thief to break them in the amount of time he would be standing behind me. Also, I felt much better about getting up to use the bathroom on planes and trains without having to haul all my junk with me. TBeware though that the color in the photo is wrong. The ones I received had a yellow back and an orange side with a purple front. No gray at all. They still worked, though and I was departing so I kept them.
B00004SR8W,4.0,I took this to Guatemala and used it to carry my passport, a credit card and cash. It worked great. I was able to sling it over my shoulder under my clothes and tuck it into my pants or shorts. It was comfortable and light weight.
B00004SR8W,3.0,Will fit under shirt or coat. To hide your money. Store card. Maybe even bank cardI just carry store card
B00004SR8W,2.0,Flimsier than I expected. It will do I guess but not the best quality. Not worth the price.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Great deal!!!please ship faster i'm traveling overseas my flight on 28th PLEASEThank you in advance!Multiple pockets and compartments organized almost anything!
B00004SR8W,3.0,Bought this for my Samsung Note 2 and while the Note does just fit it's tight and difficult to remove especially with a case on the phone and forget putting anything else in with it.  If you are using for a wallet and passport and things that size it would work nicely with room to spare.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I took this to put my money and passport in while traveling in Peru.  It was easily accessible and nothing too heavy where it hurt or bothered me.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I have yet to take this on an actual trip.  However, the product is well made, light-weight, and fits all the stuff I'll need for documentation on my journey.  I bought this one to see about quality and usefulness, and my next order will include 4 more for the others in my family.  I update this when we've used them.***update*** We took these to England.  They worked very well, light-weight, I wore mine low so I could access it from the bottom of my shirt.  We used them like wallets and wore them under our clothes.  I liked it much better than the wallet I'm using now!
B00004SR8W,4.0,I used this neck stash for a trip to Turkey and Kyrgyzstan. When I had my belongings in this, I felt very secure. It had pockets that helped with organization and despite it being pretty hot there, I didn't really feel uncomfortable with this around my neck. In fact, I wore it on the entire airplane ride because I traveled over with a substantial amount of cash, so I didn't want to just leave it in my carry on when I left my seat or was asleep.Some reviewers said that you couldn't tell they had anything under their shirt, but for me, you could tell especially if I was carrying my passport with my money. It ruined the look of some of my outfits because it pooched out in the front. I was able to stuff it down the front of my pants, but that was not always comfortable. I am only 5'3" so maybe taller people feel differently about it. It was also a little hard to get to when I was pulling money out for vendors.I like the security, but next time I feel like I need something like this, I will also get a money belt. I think having both will give me the versatility I want for different outfits and situations.As a plus, this looks okay as a little purse worn across the body too, so I will probably bring it to amusement parks and places like that.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I bought this for my European vacation ... this worked like a charmmy passport, ID, credit card plus money all fit nicely ...and there was room for receipts ...you can even sleep with itPERFECT BUY for vacation...
B00004SR8W,3.0,I recently took a trip to Italy and this pouch was very handy.  Everything I needed fit perfectly.  The only reason I didn't give it a higher star rating is because there are no zippers.  I didn't have trouble with anything falling out, but I would have felt safer if I'd gotten a pouch with zippers.
B00004SR8W,1.0,Item has Velcro closure. Item description says zipper closure. I would not have bought this if I had known it did not have a zipper. I saw references to velcro on other reviews but figured it was in addition to zipper. It's going back, and I'm not happy.
B00004SR8W,4.0,I purchased two of these for a trip to Europe to be worn under our shirts for security and safety against pick-pockets. When the pouches arrived I was pleased with my purchase. The neck straps a little on the flimsy side, I think, and could easily be cut with a knife if it were worn outside the shirt. But underneath a shirt it will be perfectly sound. These pouches will fit my passport and money/credit cards easily and not be too bulky at the same time. Velcro secures the fold over top flap.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I purchased this neck stash for my daughter as she was taking a trip to Europe.  She did not "get" that she needed to keep her money and passport close to her...like under her clothes close.  She was horrified:-).This neck stash is so soft and comfy that she quickly adjusted her attitude and had no problem wearing it.I ended up buy two more for her friends who were also going on the trip.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I used this travel wallet for 2 weeks in Italy at the beginning of August.  Despite an average temperature of about 100F, this wallet was very comfortable to wear.  The only issue was that the strap is a bit long.  As a result, the excess (which hangs over your shoulder) can sometimes be a bit bothersome.  Will definitely be using this wallet for future travels.
B00004SR8W,5.0,This item is low profile, if you don't put a lot of stuff in it.If I did put a lot of stuff in it, people just thought I gained a few pounds around the stomach area. That didn't bug me, but it might bug some people.I would put only your passport, cash and one credit card in here.If you have a hotel safe, I would put just a copy of your passport in this neck stash. Put the passport in your hotel safe.Pros:Low profileTan, looked like it was my skin on me.ComfortableVelcro is wonderfulCons:Would have liked to have a credit card/ID slotWould have liked the cord to be thinner.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Arrived as expected.  Correct size and not too small for passport and other items.  Great color and not plastc sonding like others I have had.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Really came in handy when my family and I flew overseas. Although I didn't experience any issues with the natives abroad per se, but I had the extra peace-of-mind of stashing my valuables in this pouch. The only thing that gets me is the warning label it came with.... something along the lines of "cancer causing" chemicals. Not a big deal because now of these days, our cell phones cause more radiation harm and who knows what else in our society. But why the heck do these companies have to use such materials in the first place? Why not use some more natural based materials? We're eating and breathing this stuff in droves already. Sorry for the tangent / vent but had to be said. But yeah, if you're going to wear this as an everyday carry, then perhaps I would be worried about that warning label. If it's only in moderation or an occasional trip abroad, I wouldn't be so worried. Still great product overall.One more thing, this doesn't have to be worn around the neck. I was able to secure it pretty easy around my waist and hide it under my shirt & waistline. Just pull the draw string and adjust the tie lock.
B00004SR8W,4.0,Got this for trip to Europe a few years ago.  It worked out pretty well.  I was able to keep a small amount of cash and our passports in it (just in case).
B00004SR8W,5.0,Perfect for our traveling out of the USA. Just as described and arrived very quickly. We ordered two and are glad that we did!
B00004SR8W,5.0,better quality than I expected for the price - was able to adjust it so it hung at the side rather than straight in front easily - this was our 'go-to' passport storage solution in Italy where there were a LOT of pickpockets.
B00004SR8W,1.0,Bulky, and not worth the trouble.  Just carry a shoulder bag and keep a hand on it in crowded areas.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I bought this to put my phone and keys in while walking and it's well worth it. It's simple but works great and is washable. It's very lightweight and the perfect size to hold a few things.
B00004SR8W,5.0,The neck stash is large enough for your passport, credit cards and cash, but small enough to not be noticeable. I'm about 5'5" and the larger waist bags were too bulky and large around my waist. With the cord, the Lewis and Clark can go over your shoulder or around your waist. I wore mine tucked in the waist of my pants where it was comfortable even on hot days. really helps you to be hands free while traveling and safe from pickpocketers when in the large European cities where Americans really stick out. It's washable too. Highly recommend.
B00004SR8W,4.0,I like it, it is very clever.  I think i will be using it very soon to my trip to Europe.  We will be going in a couple of month and i think this will be very handy.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I was completely satisfied with this product.  It is absolutely great for travel--stores passport and extra money.  I wore it under my shirt, over my shoulder, across my body and down to my waist, tucked under my slacks.  It was easy to get to when necessary and yet gave me a comfortable feeling of security.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I would recommend this product if you are concerned about safety with your passports / money etc.  Very lightweight and worked great.
B00004SR8W,5.0,This is a great product for travel, or anytime you want to protect your money.  It has a very long strap that is adjustable so it won't ruin the way an outfit looks. It is worn underneath your clothes.  It is lightweight and has several compartments and a velcro pocket.  Great for your phone, passport, cards and money.
B00004SR8W,1.0,First, the description as of the day of this writing is wrong. In the list of features it clearly says &#8226;Zipper closure, but there is no zipper whatsoever, there is only Velcro. Second, the way the strap adjusts is by using a bulky (and ugly in my opinion) clip mechanism that lets the excess strap hang on the side. It is not the usual loop arrangement that doubles part of the strap length, it just has a clip that shortens the strap in a similar way that you would tie a knot to shorten the strap and have the excess hanging on the side. Very inconvenient; very uncomfortable if you are going to use this under a shirt; and if not used under a shirt the hanging loop and clip are ugly!Also, given that there are other similar items out there that have a neater strap adjustment, they are also RFID inhibiting whereas this is not. So in comparison this one is not at all impressive.
B00004SR8W,3.0,I bought this, but it is too large for me. If I put anything in it, it is very visible under my shirts. I ended up buying a runner's belt with a pocket and that works much easier to strap around my upper waist. I also didn't like the idea of the string around my neck being visible. Thought of it getting caught or someone seeing it and pulling it.
B00004SR8W,5.0,....this is just the product you need when traveling...camping...or hiking! The neck strap is adjustable and fits comfortably around your neck. It will keep your cash...credit cards...and passports safe. Simply put...it's a great little product!
B00004SR8W,5.0,My daughter and I each got got one of these for a two week educational tour of Italy and Greece. We were on the go daily from 7 am to 10 pm and this handy pouch was comfortable to wear and convenient to access when dining or shopping. The adjustable neck strap allowed each of us to hang the pouch where she was most comfortable. I kept mine under my shirt and long enough to tuck at my waistband at my side, while my daughter let hers hang loosely under her t-shirts. One night I even fell asleep with mine on and was not inconvenienced.Several different pockets allowed me to keep my passport and 2 currencies separate. I was even able to carry a small nylon billfold for credit cards and receipts as well as a one page itinerary which I consulted pretty frequently.The instructions say hand wash, but we tossed ours into the washer in a lingerie bag on the delicate cycle and they came out in great shape.We heartily recommend this pouch !
B00004SR8W,4.0,Would have given it 4 stars if it had a zipper but it appears as the velcro will work just fine.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Bought this for my daughter for a Costa Rica school trip. Just the right size for passport, atm card, & some cash. All cloth so it doesn't cause sweating while wearing inside shirt. Inexpensive and delivery was fast.
B00004SR8W,3.0,I don't like that it doesn't have a zipper, only Velcro. It also wasn't deep enough to hold money without folding over bills, and I was in a country (Peru) where currency needed to be kept pristine or it wasn't accepted.
B00004SR8W,5.0,A steal at 10.99 imho.This neck stash holds my new Kindle(2010 model), phone, passport, wallet and sansa mp3 player.If the back panel was see through, I could read my kindle without taking it out of the neck stash, that would be even better :)Thank you Lewis N Clark & Amazon.Edit; If you want to be able to close the top flap, the Lewis N. Clark DELUXE Neck Stash will fit all this and you'll be able to close the flap.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Gave this to my daughter for going overseas, and it worked just fine. Fit under her clothes, and she felt it was safe and secure.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Great for traveling and you want a small bag.  It can hold a phone,  small wallet small mount of makeup for touchups.can be worn under clothing. .
B00004SR8W,5.0,Recently  purchased three of these for myself and two friends.  We used them on a recent trip to Europe and found them to be very safe and comfortable.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Perfect for what I needed to carry while on vaca. I wore across my body and forgot it was there half the time! Nice product.
B00004SR8W,3.0,The reason for three stars primarily is that unless worn under a loose fitting shirt the neck stash is quite visible more so if it is packed. I wound up using a Rick Steeves money belt instead and it worked fine if not a little inconvenient to access.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Very useful product. It was able to hold my passport, yellow fever card, boarding passes and receipts or documents that I had to show travelling through many countries.
B00004SR8W,1.0,There is no mention of the color in the description, but the photos are clearly pure white. Product is actually beige. Returned.
B00004SR8W,5.0,It is light and small with a long neck cord. Very convenient. I can fit my average sized camera in here with passport, credit cards, and cash. A little tight with everything in it but it does the job. Nice when it would be cumbersome to carry a purse or handbag.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I love this.  You can wear it around your neck comfortably.  It is excellent for travel. Soglad that I got it.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Purchased one of each type. This one and travel wallet. Neither should be used as a daily purchasing money holder. But rather as a safe hiding pouch for most money and papers.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I purchased this to not have to sit on my wallet during the warmer months (back issues) and for travel. During the colder months, my wallet is in my coat or jacket. When travelling, It is my secure wallet storing money credit cards and my passport. I like the design and the amount of items I can place in the Neck Stash. Depending on what I am doing I either wear it around my neck (going through airport security) or on the side of my body by putting it over my head and my one arm through the cord and stashing it under my pants on the side of my body.The Neck Stash meets my needs as I expected it to.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Bought this for a trip to Paris, home of recreational pick pocketing.I take it everywhere when I travel now.What I can loose goes in a cheap wallet.  What I can't loose goes here.No worries mate!
B00004SR8W,5.0,Exactly what i wanted as a gift for a friends 1st trip to europe.This is made from the soft kind of fabric that is comfortable to sleep with against your skin.Just the right amount of space to fit a passport and 2 additional sections of the same main pocket,for currency, credit cards, tickets, etc.It's important to get one like this that has no metal, so it can be worn through security check points,with metal detectors without the need to remove it.This is crucial as no one but you should know this is where the bulk of your important items are.The one main pocket is closed with a velcro strip.It also has a nice thickness to the cord and well chosen adjustment buckle for it.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I bought one of these neck stashes for my most recent cruise and used it everyday while on vacation.  You can adjust the strap to fit your taste. There are three sections and you can get quite a bit in it.  I stuffed cash, my passport, driver's license and several credit cards in it and still had some room to spare.
B00004SR8W,3.0,Plan to use this neck stash when I go to Europe this coming Fall. it will be fine, but was disappointed that it doesn't have a zippered compartment!!!! Love ordering from Amazon, always quick service!!! Judy Herrick, Maine
B00004SR8W,5.0,Daughter studying abroad did not want to take it but parents are going to Europe this Spring and they love it.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Definitely need one of these for travel to Italy.  Wear under clothes and you forget it is even there.  We traveled when weather was cool so there was no sweat, but have heard that in hot weather, may need ziploc bag to keep passport and other important papers in so that papers don't get damp.  Easily holds passport and extra money in pouch.
B00004SR8W,4.0,It's really comfy that I actually fell asleep with it on! the adjustable strap was extremely helpful and the soft material was nice. Only down side is that it heats up the area that it's touching you on and makes it cling to you which can be uncomfortable but it's definitely one of the better ones i've had.
B00004SR8W,5.0,This neck stash is a must when traveling. My husband had it around his neck, under each shirt, and we put our credit cards, passports, and cash into this. This way we knew it was safe and it was one less thing to worry about.
B00004SR8W,4.0,This neck stash did the job, I just wish it was a little stiffer and a little larger.  I did like that it had several pockets so I was able to split up my Passport, my US $ and my foreign currency.  When I purchased this product there was a note that it could hold your Kindle...well, it really can't.  It's not sturdy enough or big enough.
B00004SR8W,5.0,leaving on my trip soon--have tried the pouch on around the waist--it lays flat--and seems comfortable--check with me in a couple of weeks to see how it did on the trip.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I also bought the LNC Deluxe Neck Stash for airport travel.  This one, I use daily mainly for my smart phone & check book on road trips to town.It protects, it's easy to carry and makes things easily available with one hand.  No zippers, only Velcro on the main flap.  The interior has a mesh pocket that I don't much care for but it's not a big deal.
B00004SR8W,3.0,If you are planning on traveling with any 100 Pound or 100 Euro notes, the pouch is not long enough to securely velcro this shut.  You can fit a few in and squish them, but it makes it bulkier and annoying. If they had JUST made this 1 cm longer it would be perfect.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I would recommend this product to anyone traveling aboard.  It is the surest way to travel with the comfort that your belongings will be secure.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Mom don't always remember where things are. So this wallet for her neck gives her easy access to her money and cards. She is at home wearing cloths with no pockets. The price was good. The material is comfortable.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I purchased this neck wallet for a trip to NYC in October.  On Labor Day, I took it on a trial run to the Pittsburgh Zoo.  It was an extremely hot day and I was concerned that the wallet would be the worse for wear after the day was over.  Not So!  The light weight material dried quickly and showed no sign of the water and sweat it was subjected to.  Also, it held my money, credit cards, zoo membership card and diabetic testing supplies with ease.This is an excellent product.
B00004SR8W,4.0,We bought this for our travel in Europe and my husband used it every day to carry his passport and money. It is very light and easy to use.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I was able to wear it all day (seated and frequently walking) while barely being aware of its constant presence.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Bought this for my husband for a trip to Europe.  As far as neck wallets go he likes it more then others he has tried.  Comfortable material and not too big.  Great buy.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I really like this because I can use it for passport and money without much weight and it can be worn under clothing or over -- long enough cord to us across body and under the arm if you like.  Wearing under clothing is not very good, because you then have to be pulling up for shirt or whatever to get to stuff.  I diddn't have to worry about where the passport was when I needed it and felt better have my money where I knew it was safe.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Wonderful product!  Just got back from a week in Italy and it came in handy. Each stash has 3 pockets - I used the big one for my passport, the middle for credit cards and the small for some Euros.  I kept it under my shirt and then tucked into the waistband of my pants so it was not detectable at all under my clothes and if I needed to get it out I could discretely pull out of my waistband but probably would be better to keep a few Euros in an outside pocket.  I would like to add that my husband also had one but teased me that I was too paranoid and asked me if I was going to sleep with it.  He did put his passport under his shirt in the stash however insisted on keeping his wallet in his front left pocket and got it picked on a crowded subway.  He is such a nice guy he also had his pin number in with his debit card so the criminals were able to get money out of our checking acct quickly and easily.  They went to 3 different ATM's within 7 minutes and withdrew the daily maximum.  They also got his credit cards and driver license but because he did still have his passport we were able to get on the plane the h*ll out of Italy.  I know this isn't the place to say it but please be careful over there.  We were there the weekend of the pope's beatification and everything was jammed packed!!  It is easy to say "be alert and aware of your surroundings" but it is so much better to have your valuables under your clothes.
B00004SR8W,5.0,When traveling, I wear a money belt, but retrieving items from a money belt in public can be a bit awkward.  I felt more comfortable retrievingi tems from my neck stash.  I would like some tips (other than the obvious) about concealing the strap.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I bought this for a wheelchair-bound person living in a nursing home -- so she could keep certain things close to her, like a cell phone.  It works great. It's very light weight yet quite sturdy, and is easy to ware for long periods of time.  After having it for a year now, she is very happy with it.  She uses on every day for hours at a time.
B00004SR8W,5.0,It gives you room to keep your passport (even in a leather passport coverAmerican Tourister Leather Passport Cover), credit cards, important papers, and even has room for some money, and keeps it in a secure place around your neck.  You can keep it tucked between your shirt and t-shirt for security and still get easy access to whatever you need in it.  It is of lightweight nylon construction that doesn't make you hot where you carry it.Don't travel without it!Pluses:Prime eligibleSmall, lightweight, but holds a good bit of 'stuff'Minuses:None at this time
B00004SR8W,5.0,Item was easy to wear under clothing.  Could comfortably hold a passport and cash.  The strap was easy to adjust to various lengths around your neck.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I purchased this to hide my passport and my cash. It worked great. It was just the right size with enough pockets.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Afraid of losing your passport in a foreign land?  Get this--you can't lose it, or even misplace it.  Will use it again the next time I cross the big puddle.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Love this product. Its small and fits over your neck and under your shirt. I used it on my receint trip to Ireland. Its a lot better then a money belt. Its a lot easier to get to your money or papers and it is harder for anyone else to get to. I will take it on all my trips from now on.
B00004SR8W,4.0,I got the LNC Luggage Rfid Neck Stash, too. I got this as a backup because a few Amazon reviewers said the zippers broke on the Rfid Neck Stash. The zippers didn't break, but I mostly didn't use them. I used this a couple of times, and it did the job. Lightweight, unobtrusive, comfortable enough, easy to carry. Works well under clothes (the idea) and also serves as handy little carrier for outside the clothes, when less vigilance is required.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I got a pair of these for my wife and I for a trip to Rome and the a Mediterranean cruise. It was just what we needed. It was light weight and once we were wearing them, we really didn't notice them. It was much easier to access than my father's waist pouch, but just as secure. The separate pouches were good for organizing our money and cards. I was worried about the durability of the strap, but both of ours were solid and it was more comfortable than a cord would be.They will soak up sweat if right against your skin, and the contents can get damp. I started using little zip locks inside of it if I didn't have an undershirt on.I hope that they will change the design to a zipper or a couple of snaps for better security and reduced noise. I never had mine open unintentionally, but would feel better with a more secure closure. A couple times the loud opening of the velcro was kind of embarrassing.Overall, we were very happy with a practical and inexpensive stash that we will certainly use again.
B00004SR8W,4.0,This little bag was easy to carry, light and easy to hide under my jacket/sweater. If you are wearing tight clothes it will be visible. it's perfect for holding passports and some money/credit cards. I was glad to have it on my trip to the UK.
B00004SR8W,4.0,Going on our first trip to Europe, I wanted to be sure we were well prepared. I got a Pacsafe travel bag plus one each of these stash bags for my husband and me. The travel bag was sufficient and it kept our money safe as well as maps and camera handy - and we really didn't need these. These did come in handy for us to carry our cigarettes in, along with some cash a couple of times when a bag wasn't needed.Okay, I'm adding one more star based on another's comment since this did serve a purpose. For anyone needing something like this for travel - it arrived and stayed in great condition during the trip and still looks new 2 years later!
B00004SR8W,5.0,I bought this to replace another one I had that was kinda heavy (in comparison). I like this one MUCH better. The strap is long so you can wear it in a purse style or tighten it up and wear it under your shirt. Fits everything really well, and it's really light.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Used this on our last vacation saves from fumbling through your pockets or bags for passport or reservations. I loved using it, fits comfortable under your shirt. Had my passport, credit card and wallet in it while going through the airports.
B00004SR8W,5.0,This was a very handy wallet that I used in India.The color is near neutral so it does not show through a shirt but best to wear a vest or a jacket for additional safetyNice velcro closure keeps money safe.You can easily carry 1,000 rupee bills with comfortAlso can carry valueable documents or passports if you wishNice long neck strap that can be shortenedEasier than carrything a thick wallet in trouser pants
B00004SR8W,5.0,I used the Lewis N. Clark Neck Stash on my recent trip to Italy and France and I felt secure in knowing that all of my valuables including passports, credit cards and cash were safe. I had read some security alerts of pick pockets at the tourist areas of the places I visited and with all of my valuables in my neck stash and nothing in my pockets I felt completely safe. I placed the neck stash over my shoulder and under my arm underneath my shirt and surprisingly the patented TravelDry fabric did not transmit any sweat to the stash. I highly recommend the Lewis N. Clark for all travelers.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Can't go anywhere without this.  Comfortable material you can even wear under your clothing.  Hands free, worry free travels!  Keeps all your tickets, boarding passes, passports and money safe
B00004SR8W,3.0,This ended up being a bit of a pain when I wore it under my clothes on our recent trip to the Uk, so it ended up serving as more of an inefficient wallet in my purse.
B00004SR8W,4.0,I upgraded from my old hidden pouch and mostly am pleased with this.  I like the 3 separate compartments, so I can keep my passport separate from credit cards and money.  I also like the mesh separation between the largest and middle sized pockets so I can quickly see what is in both at the same time.  I'm guessing that the other reason for mesh is for airflow.  The strap seems to be sewn well and will adjust to a length that you could tuck this into the top of your pants, which would make it a little more convenient to reach into it as if it was a pocket. I do wish that the plastic part that is used to adjust the strap bigger or smaller was less bulky.  There is no way it won't show under summer clothes. My only other complaint is that the pocket closure is velcro so it is really noisy when you are trying to "quietly" take out money or credit cards.  I'd rather not call attention to the fact that I have a hidden pouch.  I wish it had a top zipper instead.  I'm thinking of taking off the velcro and putting a button or snap closure on it instead.
B00004SR8W,1.0,this item was a waste of money....it had 2 zippers...one broke the first day and the other one a few days later...even the velcro on the top wasn't sticking...I threw it out
B00004SR8W,5.0,Recently took a trip overseas, and this bag was invaluable.  Wish that it had come in black though.  I would recommend.
B00004SR8W,4.0,Can be worn around your neck or waist. Easy to tuck in without being bulky. Used every day without issues
B00004SR8W,5.0,Arrived on time in perfect condition. went on a 3 week trip in Africa and it was the perfect item to have.
B00004SR8W,5.0,I'm so glad I found this online at Amazon. It came in so handy on my trip to China. It is so comfortable and easy to grab when you need to pay for something. With this, I didn't need my purse and went about my day unencumbered.
B00004SR8W,5.0,Wearing these is not uncomfortable or even really noticeable.  They have nice long straps which you can adjust.I figured out that the least conspicuous way to wear it was to let the straps all the way out, then put it over one shoulder, so that the pouch hung down at about hip level on the opposite side.  Almost like you'd wear a purse or a messenger bag. Then pull up your pants over the stash and put your shirt on and tuck it in over the stash too.That way, it basically sits between your front pocket and your back pocket in the middle of your side, but is completely inaccessible and virtually invisible there.  You have to pull up your shirt out of your pants to get to it, which provides excellent security.  You don't notice it there at all while walking around either.  It is good for your passport and credit cards, but you have to fold cash in half to fit in it, which will make it bulge a bit if you put like $300 or more in $20s in there.  So if you want to carry a lot of cash in this, get large denomination bills.Mine didn't get sweaty or nasty at all, it didn't really bother me at all and we did a LOT of walking around, several miles a day with no issues.  It is not amazingly well made, but is good enough that it should last a good while.My only complaint - I wish the little thing you use to adjust the strap length was a little bit smaller and low profile.  It is the only part of the system that is really too big and so shows through your shirt at the top around the neck.
B00004SR8W,5.0,This has become a travel must-have.  I can conceal it beneath my clothes and make it difficult for thieves to grab.  I run the strap over one shoulder, across my body, and the pouch sits behind my front pocket.  It's hard to see, and nobody can access it without my cooperation.  It's very comfortable to wear, being lightweight and breathable, and its bulk lands right behind my pocket where I'm used to having some bulk anyway.  Highly recommended travel accessory.
B00004SR8W,3.0,Once I found the special travel wallets for the front pocket I never used this again.  Fear of pickpockets is over blown anyway I think having been to the &#34;worst&#34; cities of Europe and Asia.  Just don't talk to people who take an extra interest in you because you are obviously American.
B00004SR8W,4.0,Perfect size. I haven't used it yet but I'm sure it will work for me. It has just the right amount of compartments and is just the right size.
B00004SR8W,3.0,It is handy to use for carrying passport and sunglasses but a bit too wide for my preference. However, it was a lot better than the thing I wore around my waist when we went to Europe. Borrowed a narrower neck stash from my adult son that was the best solution.
B00004SR8X,2.0,I was very happy to find this product as it had a longer waist strap than most.  however, the clasp would not stay closed and the bag bunched up.  I would not recommend this product.
B00004SR8X,1.0,The pocket/fabric part seems fine.However, the belt & BUCKLE/CLASP IS VERY FLIMSY and I was afraid the whole thing would fall off while I'm walking around or into the toilet.  Sure enough, as I was leaving my home to go to the airport, the buckle broke and can't fix it.
B00004SR8X,2.0,I guess it's true , you get what you pay for. I wish I had read the description of this a little better, I wouldnt have bought it. Anyway, after wearing it a few hours it just wouldn't stay in position and a few times the zipper didn't close properly. I will buy one made of leather now.
B00004SR8X,4.0,i got this. sorry i forgot to say.. its really thin so i can see the money but good though
B00004SR8Y,4.0,Well made and fit under my clothes.  I had no problems with the zippers.  I purchased the neck stash also (which was well built), but I liked this one better, as it was pretty easy to get to, and didn't bounce around.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,We just returned from a two week trip to Europe.  My husband mostly wore this on the plane ride there.  But.....believe me it was opened and closed a lot and then stored in our hotel safe.  Safe place.....right??  My husband said that it was comfortable to wear.  He hardly noticed he had it on.  Anyway, we had no problems with the zippers as some of the reviews stated, although it was not stuffed full.  We only had the Euros and copies of our passports inside.  So bottom line is that it worked for what we needed it to do.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,This is a great little wallet for the traveler or even at home if you are the lady that doesn't like to carry a purse. But don't get me wrong it works for guys also because I first saw it or one very much like it recommended by Rick Steves on one of his T V shows. The deluxe waist stash holds all you need with room to spare and lots of separating pockets and dividers.  It is light weight and cool even in the hottest climes and stays quietly hidden and sucure. I much enjoyed its usefulness on my trip and would recommend it to all my friends.
B00004SR8Y,1.0,Thought this would work for carrying passport and credit cards, but since I'm short-waisted, it felt very awkward....can't wear it under clothes and it looked silly over my blouses.  May be good for a tall man.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,It's ok but it would be improved with a sweat proof compartment and less stretcy elastic. It kept sliding down with only 10 one thousand rupee bills and my passport in it, and I am not a tiny person. My friends who are small couldn't even get theirs to adjust small enough for their waits, and they wear a size 10 and 8. Maybe this is meant for men?
B00004SR8Y,2.0,It was to hard to use had toHad it under my cloths for my trip to Greece and stop using it as soon as I landed you had to go to the ladies room to take it off.
B00004SR8Y,2.0,If you plan on using this money belt for more than one trip, you'll probably be disappointed. It's great for a week, but it falls apart sooner than it should.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,Great Idea, kind of weird wearing it. She made fun of me everytime I had to undo my pants to fish out a 20 pounder. But my DL, Passport and company ID stayed safe the whole trip, so it was useful and worth it. I'll never leave home (the USA) without it again.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,A comfortable and secure way to carry your money and passport.  Once it's on you hardly are aware of it untilneeded.  I would never travel without this security stash.  Also it's easily laundered and drys quickly.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,I have used this with travel throughout Europe and it is great.  It has room for passports, credit cards, hotel room key and cash.  It was especially handy when traveling via train in Europe when we wanted to keep our passports physically on us.  I doesn't show under clothing and is comfortable and light weight. Excellent product
B00004SR8Y,5.0,There's quite a problem with pickpockets in Paris. I wore this under my clothes every day. It was comfortable and kept my valuables safeguarded. I highly recommend it.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,but a little uncomfortable, the fabric against the skin ... a little sweaty. Might have preferred a fastener as well.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,i used this during the whole month i was in europe, it worked great and kept my money safe from pick pockets
B00004SR8Y,5.0,This product worked well for me. I'm glad Amazon recommended it and I'm happy that I was smart enough to buy it. Good job by all.
B00004SR8Y,2.0,it is very flimsy and stiching came out right when i wore it.furthermore,it has a bad elastic, and way more over priced.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,Junk...broke while on vacation.  I would suggest upgrading to a higher quality product.  Spend the money if this falls off which it did to my husband you would not be very happy.  Thankful there are honest people in the world and gave us our wallet back when they found it on the floor!I do NOT recommend this product!
B00004SR8Y,5.0,I used it on my recent trip and it worked flawlessly.  I had it inside my shorts, even inside my underpants where it could not fall even if the straps broke, which they certainly did not.  I recommend this highly.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,Just OK. The elastic on the band was so stretched out when I received it, I couldn't tighten it up enough to fit around my waist. The material was fine and so were the zippers. It was larger than I had expected but I was able to sew the band and use it.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,Never used a money belt before.  Very comfortable to wear and flt very safe from pickpockets.  Highly recommend this brand.
B00004SR8Y,2.0,I was disappointed with my pouch, I no more than left on my trip, when both of the zippers let go at the corners and allowed the zipper to open and stay open.  We worked and got the zipper back on the track, but had to be careful not to pull it too far open, or it came apart again.  This was a disappointment to me.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,I used this for 10 days in Rome during the hot June weather.  It was perfect.  I avoided having to carry a purse and didn't have to worry about pickpockets which are everywhere in the crowded city.  I am very happy with this and will use it in the future of all travel.  It was very reasonable in price too.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,I purchased this belt for my recent trip to Italy since I was going to be visiting areas with numerous pickpockets. The belt is very comfortable; however, after using it for only two days, the zipper broke. And I did not over-stuff the stash area to create the problem. I was able to retrack the zipper but am disappointed that this happened. Also a better design would allow for securing the belt (excess) that goes around your waist.
B00004SR8Y,1.0,Not what I expected...
B00004SR8Y,5.0,We travel a lot so I feel this item is great for my husband, very thin so when it is under his shirt you can't tell that it is there. Good for protecting you passport, money, etc.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,My daughter used this in Europe - she said it worked well but always had it tucked into undergarments because the strap was flimsy and she was worried it might break.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,I used this for both Asia and Europe travel. Especially in Paris because there are a lot of pick pocketers, but I didn't use this as an alternative for a purse. I just put the most valuable items in it (passport, EXTRA money, id, etc..) and hit it in my pants. It is very thin and versatile.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,Light weight  It hide securely under your shirt and it is perfect to carry money while traveling. It did exceeded our expectations.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,The product arrive on time.  The material is very solid and good quality.  Safe for traveling documents, and stashes.  Love it.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,I purchased this waist stash because Lewis N. Clark items are recommended on travel sites. This particular waist stash is light and slim. It conforms to your body but it has two things that could be improved upon. The outer pocket's zipper broke on the second day of use. I now see on other reviews that it has happened to other folks as well. The second item that could be improved is the waist band itself. There should be some way to tuck in or pin up the excess waistband once you adjust it to your waist size. The excess just dangles or slips up underneath your clothing making it obvious that you are wearing a waist stash. It defeats the purpose of having your money and passport discreetly hiddend under your clothes.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,I use this on all my trips.  I even use it when I'm traveling at home.  I may carry a tote, but my money, credit cards, and passport are in the &#34;Stash.  I'm hands free and I don't have to worry about busy hands in my tote when I'm not looking or my backpack.  If I'm on a short trip and don't need anything else (jacket, camera, etc), I am now hands free and my valuables aren't in view.  I like that it has two pockets.  It lays flat.  It is soft and easily adjustable.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,It's a very nice product and if needing a waist pack I'd buy this one. Thought we'd use it all the time on our month long trip to Spain but turns out all the hotels had safes and we just kept all our valuables in the pack and put it in the safe. So it was convenient keeping everything in one place, we just didn't use it as a waist pack.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,bought one of these from a local store, more expensive than getting it at amazon.compros: light weight, good for carrying money.cons:Need stronger elastic band belt -when I carried three 60-page passport with it, the elastic band was stretched and dragged so it is not so invisible under my shirt. Therefore, I wore it through the belt loops of my pants but since It did not go through the metal detector it is a hassle to take it off and put it back in. I sometimes only wore the detachable side through one belt loop, when I wore it with two belt loops - one on each end, it is better, but the bag would kind of stick out more since it is longer than the distance between the two front belt loops of my pants (I have a waistline of 36+one of the zippers split the first time I used it, but it stayed close after that.So light weight that sometimes I had to feel it to see if it's still there.The front pocket could barely fit one passport - kind of difficult to get it in and out.
B00004SR8Y,4.0,I ordered this for my trip and was surprised at how comfortable it was.  I hardly knew I had it on and I wore it while doing construction.  Only wish it was more water resistant.  Money was always damp.
B00004SR8Y,1.0,I purchased this money belt for my husband for a 5 week stay in Italy. It was not heavily used. The elastic in the belt started unraveling after week 2. The zipper on the upper compartment(the most useful compartment of the 2) broke during week four. I would not recommend this product.
B00004SR8Y,4.0,My husband actually wore this in Italy.  He said it was a little awkward to get to at times but all in all he liked the simplicity of it and true to its word, kept hidden.  Very light, but sturdy material.
B00004SR8Y,5.0,Bought this for my husband for our trip to Turkey. Worked great for keeping out money and passports safe. Thanks for the sale.
B00004SR8Y,3.0,It becomes a little bulky and cumbersome at times especially if you have to wear it for an extended time.
B00004SR8Y,4.0,This was good, its very rugged and stood up to wear and tear quite well. It was reasonably comfortable and presumably unobtrusive. I'm sure it will last a long time.
B00004SR8Y,4.0,I really like the material and the pockets have enough space to hold money, passports and tickets. I wish the waist band could have something to hold the end of the band, just like the belt. My waist is 34 and the handing band, after adjustment, doesn't look so nice.
B00004SR8Y,2.0,It works ok and is breathable. We use it in Rome in August, so you can imagine how hot it is. However, it is ripped, just after 3 days of use. disappointed.
B00004SR8Z,3.0,If you plan on wearing a t-shirt or any shirt without a collar, then this will be obvious to everyone around you. To adjust it, you have to pull the extra cord through the clip, but there it no place for the extra cord to go, so it just sort of flops over the back of your neck making it even more visible. I also bought a money belt for the same trip that I used when moving from city to city. This worked better for me. On the plus side though, I found the neck wallet was nice for organizing my valuables (extra credit cards, passport etc.) when I placed them in the room safe.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,It's &#34;fit for purpose&#34; and 'money well spent'!
B00004SR8Z,4.0,Seems well made.  I had no problems with the zippers.  I bought this and the waist stash and liked the waist stash better, as I am a pretty small woman and the neck stash was bulky under summer clothes.  Glad to have it anyway, for future travel.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I used this every day for a month long international trip. It is durable yet soft and the bet part is the storage.  I packed documents and two pens in one, small phone in the second, and used the two side pockets for american cash/credit cards and the last for local currency.  I made many purchases for this long trip and this little stash was the best value of all
B00004SR8Z,3.0,I am going to try and return this, as I find it too bulky to wear hidden under my shirts/dresses. I wanted something just big enough for my passport, so it is my fault that I didn't realise it was going to be this big. It looks nice and flat in the photos though, but once you fold the top flap down it buckles a bit around where the straps are attached, so it's not that flat.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I love this product and would recommend it to everyone, good product easy to use and very safe, your eyes on your bilonggins .
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Dear,I like this bag for my passport, air ticket , &others; emergency papers.If u need somewhere then take out very easy.if you need passport bag you can buy it.I hope enjoy your journey.Best RegardsAbdul Ahad Khan
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I purchased this item as well as its "worn around the waist" counterpart for a trip to Asia. I actually used this item more often. It fit securely around my neck. The strap was comfortable. It was well concealed beneath even my T shirt. The neck strap was adjustable. If I had my shirt untucked I had the strap longer in order to access it at my waist. If my shirt was tucked in I had it higher in order to pull it out of the collar for access. The only recommendation I have is to place your items in plastic ziplock bags. You will inevitably sweat while wearing this. The sweat will go through the silk into your items if not covered in plastic. It easily held my money, passports, and other important items. It did not set off metal detectors at the airport which was a huge bonus for me. It was also discreet and I never felt in danger of being robbed. Of course, this depends on where you are in the world!
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Wore this everyday under clothing while hiking across Spain.Very comfortable and easy to access with all the zipper compartments.Love it.
B00004SR8Z,2.0,Although I like the design of this neck stash I can't recommend it. The stitching along the back edge came apart on my first trip. I will sew it up and use it again, but shouldn't have to make repairs on a new product.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,If you do not want it to dangle around your waist, you can adjust where it sits on your chest by moving a spring-loaded clip ... but if you prefer it closer to the top of your chest, then it will leave a long strap dangling down at the back of your neck - which is not the most comfortable, and which probably makes the whole item more visible and less secure!  Would have preferred some type of buckle mechanism.  Overall, not bad though - it did the job for our recent vacation.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I've used this neck stash extensively while traveling overseas.  It has several pockets: making it easy to segregate cash, ID's and charge cards.  It has stood up to the rigors of travel very well - does not seem to stain (with sweat, for instance) easily, and looks as good as new, with no discernible wear.My concerns with the product are as follows:1) The neck cord is incredibly long.  It has an adjuster, but there is an awful lot of &#34;slack&#34; which hangs down my back.  I suppose I could cut the cord to make it shorter, perhaps knotting the ends, but doing so might increase the risk of losing the Stash, so I've not done so.  This is, at most, a minor inconvenience - and it makes sense for the manufacturer to make the cord long, &#34;just in case.&#34;  So, this has not affected my rating of the product.2) My other concern, and this is one that would be true of any such product, is that you cannot wear it under lighter weight fabrics without it showing, which to some extent defeats the purpose of it.  Again, since I think this is a problem you'd see with any such product, it has not affected my rating of it.Overall I am happy with the product.  It is well designed, does it's job well, and is durable.  5 stars!
B00004SR8Z,1.0,I went to open the zipper and the zipper and the pull came right off the first time I used it.  Very disappointed.
B00004SR8Z,3.0,This pouch is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and I liked the very adjustable strap.  However, I would like for the pouch to be a couple of inches longer to accommodate the length of a standard boarding pass.  I was surprised that it was too short as it seems to me that travel documents would the the most likely thing to store here, but it could not be closed unless I bent the passes which then made them difficult to remove.  A minor gripe, overall I'm satisfied.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Worked well for my entire trip. It was able to hold all my passport and other paperwork with ease. Has a velcro pocket along with 2 zippered pockets that came in handy. Size is a little big to be perfectly concelaed but you can't have everything. I would highly recommend for what it is.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I was a little skeptical of this when I bought it, but is has worked very well. It has two separate pockets with a Velcro flap for passports and other travel documents, plus two separate zippered compartments on either side for currency. Recommend this highly for travelers that want to keep their essentials close, easy to get to, and secure.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,This is an awesome little bag!  I got my phone and my camera in it easily!  Strap is long enough to wear on side, waist or neck.  This versatility gives you safe options when attending festivals.  I highly recommend this bag!
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Ordered 3 of these for an international trip. They were durable and easy to use. To prevent theft, simply put inside of your shirt/blouse. Reduces the chance someone will cut the cord and run (like purse snatchers do).We had to go through security at multiple airports, including TSA checks. These stashes made it simple to retrieve passports and boarding passes as needed. Will use often and highly recommend.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,After getting robbed in Calexico CA I decided to get smart and stash my important cards, ID and cash someplace else besides my purse! This fits the bill ! I have the important stuff around my neck and down my blouse where I can feel it and know where it is all the time. I feel so much better knowing where my valuables are now. Losing your ID and credit cards is Royal Pain in the you know where. I recommend this item to avoid losing your stuff to a thief !  It is made well and is comfortable to wear what else can you ask?
B00004SR8Z,5.0,After reading about the notoriously quick fingered pickpockets around Rome and Paris, I was understandably nervous.Fortunately, this neck stash was the perfect defense.It was mostly comfortable, could hold 4 passports, had multiple storage areas, and was absolutely convenient. And, it still looks as good as new after daily usage in humid sweaty weather.Highly recommended.Happy Travels!
B00004SR8Z,2.0,This bag was a good size, but it seemed flimsy.  The cord is thick and cumbersome, and hangs awkwardly when shortened.  Also, the cord was only attached to the edges of the flap, which seems as if it could tear off more easily.  I have seen more sturdy, yet lightweight products.
B00004SR8Z,1.0,Used for one trip - both zippers broke within the first days of the trip.  Other than that, it's a great idea, but it's not terribly useful when both zippers break.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,This product was just as described and arrived rapidly so that my daughter could use it for her trip to Europe.  Thanks!
B00004SR8Z,4.0,This is a Christmas gift for my sixteen year old son. He likes things basic, and this is exactly that. A basic passport and money holder for travel. The color is not like the picture at all, but I am keeping it and letting him decide.The very light beige will get dirty quickly.The zippered section is fine. I wish the passport section had a zipper instead of velcro. For the price, it is adequate.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,This storage packet came in handy while touring Europe.  It gave me a sense of security that I was seeking.  It was however, a bit uncomfortable and bulky.  Overall, it did what it was supposed to do.
B00004SR8Z,2.0,I am not quite sure how people wear these, but for me, it looked so bulky under my shirt that I decided not wear it.  I do not recommend if you are trying to &#34;hide&#34; money, however, if you don't care, then go for it.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Easy to use, very light weight, excellent buy for  serious travelers, I highly recommend it, thank you for making my trips more save.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,It is easy to  put all travel document together in one place. Retrieval is easier that fumbling in my purse.Not too bulky and organizes well.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I was very pleased with this product.  It worked inside, under or over my shirt.  I was able to tuck it in the waistband of my pants when under my shirt.  Carried my cash, credit card, passport,sunscreen for lips and other small items.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,Good for travelling when you don't want to carry a wallet or purse.  Serves a good purpose.  Not for everyday use.  Good product.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,this pack is a must have for international travel.  if your looking to conceal you documents, this is not what your looking for because it is a bit bulky.  but if your looking for document/passport storage with easy access this works great.  passed through security lines with ease, never wasted time searching for documents at airports.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I bought three of these Two are for gifts and one for me. Very practical and the fabric wicks away sweat. Highly recommended and very easy on the pocket book!
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I am really happy with this purchase. I has able to fit 2 passports, multiple currencies, maps, itinerary, cellphone, etc. with no problems. It did get heavy but if you stick it in a pocket or pants with the lanyard around your neck you begin to forget about it. I will definitely be using this on all of my trips, much easier than a purse that attracts too much attention.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Very easy to use.  The strap was extremely comfortable around your neck.  Many compartments for a variety of documents, currency, etc.  The adjustable strap came in very handy.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I bought this pouch for a music festival. I was worried about losing my wallet, cellphone, or keys out of my pants pockets while dancing around, and this pouch solved that.I had been concerned that the neck strap adjustment mechanism wouldn't be strong enough to support the weight of all my stuff, but it's plenty strong.I highly recommend this pouch. It's lightweight, yet incredibly durable (it's made of rip-stop fabric). A few times, I panicked because I thought I had lost the pouch, but it is just so comfortable I simply forgot it was there. There's plenty of room for an entire wallet (though more comfortable to just take out the cards and cash you need), cellphone, keys, pad of paper, pen, and change.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,I recently purchased this neck pouch for a 3-week trip to Italy.  I actually wore it around my waist most of the time because I didn't want the neck strap sticking out of my shirt.  It was very light and comfortable to wear and I actually found myself checking from time to time to make sure I hadn't lost it.  This may be a liability because you could potentially lose it and not be aware of it because it's so light.  The backing on the pouch does make it comfortable to wear against your skin and this pouch has 2 zippered pockets on the side which I used to separate my currencies.  There is also a velcro top pocket which has a divider.  I used this pocket for my passport and important documents (copies of my credit cards and important phone numbers).I liked this pouch better than others I've had in the past because of the comfort, weight, and various pockets.  One other note, I would recommend putting papers in ziplock bags (just in case) because this pouch doesn't protect against water if you get it wet. I had my passport in the top back pocket (which was the closest to my skin) and despite sweating quite a lot (it was hot in Rome), my passport was fine.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,Loved the zippered compartments; lightweight and unobtrusive; fit comfortably around my neck; would like a flatter closure for the neck cord.
B00004SR8Z,1.0,I ended up going to a flea market in San Diego that had way better brand new neck purses for three dollars.  This Lewis N. Clark was not worth the money.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Fantastic for traveling. It holds passport, money, credit cards, and even a cell phone. I wore it inside my clothes while traveling in Asia and never worried about my property getting stolen.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I got this for my son, who was traveling to Europe.  He was hesitant to wear something around his neck all the time, thinking it would be hot and bulky.  This "Neck Stash" was so much better than either of us expected.  It is lightweight and breathable, while still feeling secure.  I highly recommend it!
B00004SR8Z,3.0,Seemed to be well made, and the multiple pockets were helpful to keep different currencies, passport, and even cell phone separate.  However, on a one week humanitarian trip to a third world area where I used it constantly in lieu of a purse, the velcro was frayed and in poor shape.  It would be fine for the person who isn't needing to be in and out of it constantly.  It was comfortable, lightweight, not excessively hot even in a humid climate, and the neck/shoulder strap was adjustable from very short to very long.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,I bought two of these pouches for a recent vacation to Europe.  It was comfortable to wear as long as I didn't put too much in it.  It was fine with credit cards, driver's license and some cash but when I added my passport it became a bit heavy and bulky, but not prohibitively so.  I think if you are planning on carrying your passport with credit cards it will work well for you, but if you are not planning on carrying your passport around, a pouch that is smaller might work better.This pouch is likely a good size if you are carrying quite a bit of stuff, but it will stick out under your clothes if your passport is in it.  A lot  more comfortable with only a bit of cash and credit cards.It is also a l longer in length than I realized.  Its so long that I could wear it around my neck and tuck it into my pants.  My daughter refused to wear it since it is quite bulky under your clothes.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Picked this up for a recent trip to the Caribbean and it really worked out to be a great purchase. Credit cards, license, etc. in one zippered pocket, cash in the other, and passports in the middle for the airport. On the island, leave the passports hidden in the room and just wear this. I never worried about leaving my wallet behind and no bulge in the pocket. It is a little bulky to wear inside of a t-shirt, but worked perfect under my Exofficio shirts. Back home, it's perfect for the ballgame. I really love this stash!
B00004SR8Z,4.0,it is ok for passport and small documents. i purchased for my kids son it works good. good value for the price
B00004SR8Z,5.0,It is great.  I fit my cell phone, passport, credit cards, change, currency and the neck or shoulder strap is adjustable.  Very light weight.  I like the Velcro.  I would buy another one in a minute.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,For the ease of finding/storing your passport or boarding passes while at the airport, this product works well.  No having to fumble in the luggage pockets nor fear of dropping  anything.For daily wear though, I would like to see some sort of discreet strap.  The present one is to obvious as to what it is.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,This is a great aid traveling.... but you need to wear a loose fitting shirt... it shows veryobviously under t-shirts...
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Wore all around Italy for 2 weeks. I wore as 'cross body' to make it easer to get into. Thin and light weight. Will use again.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,This is the type of pouch recommended by TV travel hosts. Bought one for my son for trip to France; VERY HANDY and VERY HIDDEN.RECOMMEND.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,We were familiar withg the Lewis N. Clark Deluxe Neck Stash since we have had one in the past but seem to have mislaid it somewhere. So when we needed one to travel abroad again, we went back to something with which we were familiar and which we knew would do what we wanted and needed.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,Family is heading out of the country, so I needed a &#34;travel wallet.&#34; I've been down to Mexico before, and a big, bulging wallet is a bad idea. (Technically, neck wallets aren't a great idea, either: thieves have learned to look for them, and they can grab the neck strap, cut it, and run off very quickly. Caveat emptor.)The wallet is made from a nice, synthetic-feeling fabric. It's comfortable to wear, yet durable. It's bigger than you'd think from the picture - it'll hold most currencies without folding, so everything is nice and flat. There are four pockets that are as big as the entire wallet. I was kind of hoping for a card-sized pocket (for ID), but no. However, since there are two pockets accessed from the top (under the Velcro-closing flap), and two pockets accessed from zippers on either side, you have options on what to put where. Think about where you want to put things, and you should be able to pull this out, get what you need, and put it back under your shirt pretty quickly.So, I recommend this as a cheap, simple way of carrying things with some security, but keep in mind that it isn't perfect. Maybe consider another wallet, or buy this one and reinforce the strap yourself.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,I used this during hajj under my abaya. It worked except I threw it out at the end of the trip because the back was destroyed from the rubbing. Also even though the strap is adjustable if your bag is a little heavy (digital camera) it will undo to the longest setting slowly
B00004SR8Z,2.0,GREAT idea but the back pocket tore away @ the seam so I couldn't put anything in the back pocket. Not good in Haiti!!!
B00004SR8Z,2.0,Smaller than I thought.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,I purchased these for our trip to Italy.  Both my husband and I used them.  It was very convenient to be able to carry passport and money without worrying about theft.  I carried even more in mine so once or twice the neck cord was a little uncomfortable from the weight, but if you use it just for money and passports, it works well.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,Ordered this for my daughter who is traveling abroad.  Appears well made & useful, however, the neck strap is a bit long causing it to be bulky under her shirts.  I would recommend the item.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I purchased 4 of these in preparation for a trip to France.  It was the ideal size!  It comes with 3 separate pockets, 2 closed with zippers that were the perfect size for a passport.  The 3rd pocket was closed with velcro at the top and had a mesh pocket that divided it in two.  This was perfect for holding money.  It was very lightweight and confortable to wear and the adjustable neck strap allowed me to easily set the desired length.  I was not disappointed in my purchase and I would strongly recommend it for anyone who's planning on travelling overseas.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,We have used these safety wallets before and found them very useful when we check-in for our international flights and for storing money and passports. We definitely recommend it.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,This security pouch with an adjustable neck cord (long enough to be worn outside of clothing across the body) was perfect for my trip.  It features two side zippered pockets and two long, divided inner compartments that were secured with velcro strip at top. The silk back side (against the skin) was a good feature, too.  I am very glad I purchased it.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,very comfortable! I travel around the world and in places that are a little less civilized this is a VERY useful thing to have. I keep it under my shirt and the soft back doesn't irritate me, although it does show if you have only a tee-shirt or anything tight. the neck strap is very long and adjustable so it works well for me. the zipper pocket has been useful for loose or small items. The size is perfect for keeping passport, cash, cards and travel documents. I have a better pocket for my passport and credit cards, but this one offers more space to store and separate your items.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I took this to Israel with me and it worked wonderfully. I used it as an every day purse and was able to keep it close to me with the adjustable clasp.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,I immediately purchased this useful product after my passport slipped out of my wallet during a trip abroad.If the product was more stealthy it would earn 5 stars. However, Irrespective of height adjustment, I found that it was visible bulging through my T-shirt whilst traveling. It helped to raise it higher towards the chest than to lower it toward my abdomen. I also tried extending the neck loop and stuffing it into my pants, but it would back out as I walked and then fall forward against my t-shirt. I don't want to look like a drug mule when I go through customs, nor do I wish to attract attention to myself among the locals. Perhaps something worth hiding may be worth having. If I find a better way to place it flush, I will update this review.However, I cannot imagine another product that would function any better. The only real functional complaint I might have is that it's a very tight fit shoe-horning a passport into either of the side zipper pockets. Fits, but that extra time and fumbling can mean dropping something when trying to quickly access documents.The wallet is slim, high quality, and offers enough storage space to satisfy me. I plan to use it often and give it two thumbs up. It gives me tremendous piece of mind.
B00004SR8Z,1.0,I bought this for a European vacation.  I used it for all of 20 minutes before it started coming apart at the seams.  Thankfully I had brought my everyday wallet with me and was able to use it.  I had my passport and a little cash in it, it was in no way over loaded.  Very poor quality.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,This little Neck Stash, though small enough to be discreet, is well organized to provide instant accessto cash, credit cards, and keys.  The adjustable neck cord adjusts to varying needs. I wear mine withthe cord long enough to tuck in my waistband. It is a must for secure travel.
B00004SR8Z,3.0,The money stash worked ok until the adjuster on the strap broke.  It kept fully extending and I had to tuck my neck stash in my underware, which really kept everything safe!
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Bought this for our Mexico trip, but ended up loving it for my neighborhood walks even more than for traveling. its so light weight and the adjustable strap makes it great for carrying my mp3 player, keys and phone. This has alot of secure sections,-2 zippered and two long ways,seperated by a net mesh. Very durable, and versatile
B00004SR8Z,1.0,Purchased these for a trip to Italy for myself and my wife.  The zipper on her's broke after 4 days and my zipper broke after 6 days.  Very disappointing for a product that has such great reviews.  I would not purchase these again for any other overseas trips.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,I got this for my trip to Portugal this past September.  It is wonderful for keeping travel documents and other valuables together.  But,  after one use on my person, it spent the rest of the trip in my luggage.  I'd use it again but I wouldn't wear it (but that's just me).
B00004SR8Z,5.0,This pouch is very handy and is just what one needs to keep passport, credit cards and cash safe yet accessible.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,One of the first things I hear from friends when I say I'm traveling somewhere is "watch for pickpockets". This travel pouch which you wear around your neck is the perfect answer. The middle pocket is big enough to store your passport and any other IDs or documents you need to secure and even has a divider. There are two side pockets so you can divide up your money to big bills and small bills, or use one for money and the other for credit cards, whatever you want. The neck cord is adjustable so it can be easily made to fit anyone. I found this pouch easier to use than the ones you wear across your waist because I was able to access it either by pulling it down below my shirt or up through the top of my shirt (whichever was easier with the shirt I was wearing). The material it is made out of is nice because it never irritated my skin; in fact, I mostly forgot I had it on except when I needed it. Wearing this, I was able to carry my money and passport with me and not worry about pickpockets.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,On a recent 4 week trip, I used this neck stash, along with an eagle greek undercover hidden pocket. Both were great.I used the eagle creek one for passports and things not commonly accessed, and I used this neck stash for my more frequently accessed items. Local money, rail pass, credit card, etc. I actually left it as long as it went (around my neck), and tucked it into my jeans. Someone would have had to have tried very hard to steal it. I also wore it as it is meant, around my neck at about chest height. It was perfectly comfortable, but very noticeable with a T-shirt. When I tucked it in my pants, it was hard to tell it was there.I'll definitely use it on my next trip.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,This carrier worked well in Rome.  It didn't get too hot in the heat.  It did exactly what it was supposed to.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Used this on my recent 10 day trip to Italy and it was the most convenient way to handle all of my &#34;necessary&#34; paperwork that had to be ready on the spot -- going thru security checks at airports, customs, etc. Also handled things nicely when I was sightseeing, making everything available, around my neck, without the need of a big, clumsy bag.  Wonderful. Sturdy construction, lightweight.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,looks like it will work perfect for what I need it for.  nicely put together. Neutral in color.  I would recommend for traveling
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I recently used this neck stash on a two week trip to France.  It was wonderful!  I loved it at the airport and at train stations, especially.  It is so helpful to have my hands free yet my passport and bording pass (or train ticket) ready to pull right out instead of fumbling in a purse.  I also carried money and credit cards in it and in extremely crowded tourist areas (like the Eiffel Tower) I wore it under my shirt for extra security.  It's lightweight and the adjustable neck strap, when adjusted properly, makes this pretty unnoticeable under a shirt.  I love the different compartments, as this makes it easier to find what you're looking for right away.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,Lots of safe space to stash stuff. Cord seems strong and adjusts easily. Not too bulky. I like it a lot.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I purchased the Lewis Clark Deluxe for my trip to Europe and it did exactly what I purchased it for.  Worked out great!
B00004SR8Z,2.0,fell apart too easliy. cannot depend on this for travel. Should be manufactured more sturdily to be worthy of travel.
B00004SR8Z,5.0,The item was just what we needed for our son to keep his passport and $$. He is on an international study abroad experience in China.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,This neck stash is very comfortable and it's a nice size. There are two zippered pockets for cards, passports, cash, etc. and a large velcro flap for larger bills or boarding passes.
B00004SR8Z,1.0,Purchased this for a trip to Turkey.  Seemed well-made and convenient until the zipper broke  the first afternoon of use. It was a real bummer!
B00004SR8Z,4.0,used it on my first trip to japan. had plenty of compartments for me to store my passport, cash, yen, boarding passes
B00004SR8Z,4.0,I have yet to travel using the product; however, I can already tell it's going to be a lot better than the waist type.
B00004SR8Z,2.0,I bought this for my recent Europe trip. On day one, the sewing came out on the right side. I had to superglue it to use it throughout the trip. On day two, the attachment to the pull-tab came off. I like the design, but the quality seems to be lacking. Not sure I could recommend it to others based upon my experience.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,I used this on my Cancun vacation. I was able to carry my passport, cards and cash in it. At the airport, i slip my boarding passes in to. i didn't have to juggle things because i had this handy stash.
B00004SR8Z,2.0,Others are right that it is difficult to put U.S. passports in the side zipper pockets of this stash.  If they had made that part of the stash about 1/2 in. longer, it would have been fine.  The passport can fit in the top but that is not zippered and it is better suited for money.  I returned this for a deluxe Eagle Creek undercover neck wallet which has a longer zippered pocket.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,Looks good and very handy specially for me as I do a lot of traveling as I'm a seaman.I would have given a 5 star if it had a pocket at the back.
B00004SR8Z,4.0,The material is very comfy, and it feels good against your skin. There are two zippered pockets, and a velcro pocket that has a mesh divider within it. It fit all my cash, my passport, and credit cards comfortably. Only minor complaint that I have is that with all your stuff in it, it does become a bit bulkier, and unless you have a sweater or jacket on, it will most likely be visible. My girlfriend also ordered one, and it tends to show more visibly on her as well (without much in it) because her shirts aren't as loose as mine. But seeing as how I will be going someplace cold and wearing a jacket anyways, this neck stash is perfect! Also, when you tighten the straps to make it smaller, the excess straps just kind of hang behind your neck in a little loop. It's not too uncomfortable but I did notice it at times. Still, nothing can beat the peace of mind knowing that most of my cash is hanging comfortably around my neck and out of reach of pickpockets. Buy this for the security, and not for the looks!
B00004SR8Z,5.0,I used it for a pretty long trip to keep my passport and cash close to me.It works as expected and the fabric is actually pretty comfortable to wear.
B0017QA1AU,3.0,If you are athletic like I am & not a supermodel you will need to order 2 sizes larger to get the boot to zip over the calf. Since I bought them for my &#34;Foxy Cleopatra&#34; halloween outfit they were worn underneath flared disco jumpsuit, but I couldn't zip them any further than just below the calf muscle X(
B0017QA42A,2.0,ordered a size 8..smaller than expected, so need a size in 8.5 or a 9. Fashionable shoe. actually easy to walk in, but will be returning for a size that fits comfortably, as I intend to wear them.
B0017QA6AK,5.0,got this for my boyfriend as an early christmas present (feet get cold before christmas hits!) and he absolutely loved them. mostly because of the awesome Star Wars factor, but they are very warm and well made. thick on the bottom. i have no doubt they will last him a few winters at least
B0017QA6AK,4.0,Very nice looking and comfortable. Stitched well. Very detailed.Goes well with Darth Vader Robe.Would recommend. Thick head keeps toes warm.
B0017QA98O,5.0,Very nice quality...no complaining from my daughter who thinks that everything itches.  This is more like the material of an actual dress instead of a costume.  I suppose that the quality will allow this to tolerate many dress-up sessions.
B0017QA98O,5.0,Great fit. Room to grow for my tall 4 yr. old!!! I love the length, flow, and design of the dress. She won't stop wearing it!!!
B0017QA98O,5.0,My daughter wanted to buy the Dorothy costume that we saw at Target but they did not have her size.  I am glad they didn't because this costume is much higher quality.  The fabric is not shiny or sticky and stood up to a washing.
B0017QA98O,5.0,My daughter is dressing up as Dorothy for a State fair she's doing for school.  After tons of research on the best Dorothy costume to buy, I came across this one as a last resort since all the other ones in her size were sold out.  I'm so glad it worked out that way!  As previous reviewers wrote, costume is more dress quality then typical dress-up clothes for girls.  It is very soft and detailing on the costume is excellent including the seams sewn perfectly with no thread hanging out.  I didn't pick this dress initially because I was worried about the size.  My daughter is on the husky side and she usually wears an XL-XXL which in most most costumes would not fit.  Luckily this costume has a stretchy back (and no velcro) so it has more give and flexibility when she's wearing it.  And no velcro means the costume will actually stay on instead of popping open every few minutes!  This costume is awesome and with the best price anywhere online or in stores!  Amazon shipped fast and it came in perfect condition!  Thank you!
B0017QA98O,5.0,I was so extremely pleased with this costume, it is so soft and almost feels hand made.  The costume is gorgeous and is of high quality.  It twirls very nicely and my little girl doesn't want to take it off.
B0017QA98O,5.0,Got my granddaughter wizard of oz musical tickets  the dress is perfect shoes are awesome !  Can't wait to dress her up and go !
B0017QA98O,5.0,This costume is adorable, of good quality, and less expensive than most of the Dorothy costumes out there.  We are very pleased.
B0017QA98O,5.0,as others have stated - i too did and extensive search to find the right dorothy costume  --  i wanted something made of cotton and not the shiny and hot polyester that a lot of the other costumes are made of --- this one was perfect -- it is like an actual dress -- just  slip it on over the head ( no buttons or velcro to attach ) and the back is stretchy fabic so it goes with the movements of your child ... the length is perfect  -- i also ordered the red sequin shoe attachments and that has completed my little girls ' dorothy ' look ......  as i said -- very nice costume.....
B0017QA98O,5.0,I have purchased Dorothy costumes before and have returned the dresses due to quality & sizing, and I must say that I am so happy with the quality of this dress. It is a great buy, size is very close to typciall sizing, and the quality is superb.  I will most likely buy another one so that my grand daughter can have one at my house and one at her house.
B0017QA98O,5.0,Lots of Dorothy's out there. This one is well constructed and well detailed. We used it for a stage performance, not just an hour or two of trick or treating and it did not dissapoint.
B0017QA98O,5.0,My daughter wears a size 8-10 and I purchased the LG 10-12.  She had a little wiggle room and because it the bodice is a stretchy material, it felt great on her.  We also purchased the the 6x-8 size and while that fit her, she would not have any room to grow.  She loved the costume because it was soft and comfortable and very similar to the movie version.  Great buy!
B0017QA98O,5.0,This costume is exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered it. It is the right size for my petite 7-year old daughter, well constructed, and very sweet. Can't wait for Halloween!
B0017QA98O,5.0,My granddaughter loves this products.  The fit was great the quality of the product was also great.
B0017QA98O,4.0,This costume is really nice. Well made of decent fabric & a perfect match to Dorothys costume. I usually make my kids costumes for dress up but this one I decided to buy. The cost was affordable & the sizing accurate.
B0017QA98O,5.0,Great!  My daughter decided to be Dorothy for Hallowe'en after seeing a costume in a store but they didn't have her size.  I found this one online and it was much nicer than the ones I found in the store.  Much better quality.  I bought the size for 6 - 8 year olds since my daughter is a pretty standard size six year old and it was perfect.  Roomy enough that I could fit her jacket and a shirt on underneath for Hallowe'en night but fine without anything too for the school party.
B0017QA98O,4.0,Nice costume, but did not come with the hair ribbons listed in the product description.  disappointed that the costume was not all there
B0017QA98O,5.0,This was surprisingly well made of quality.  We bought it for Halloween but it has been used for dress up since and is still holding up!
B0017QA98O,5.0,This is a wonderful, little girl costume!  I am not a prude but I do bristle at the short dress Dorothy costumes for children. If you look, Judy Garland's original dress came down past her knees!!!  This costume keeps better with the spirit of a little girl dressing up as Dorothy, as my 6 year old did this year.  Sizing is spot on, my daughter wears a size 8 and the dress came right to her knees.  It might be a little big if a child is just fitting into a size 6 or 6x but it's great for 7s and 8s, including putting clothing underneath.  Here in New England, Halloween is generally a cold night and this costume met all our needs perfectly!  The detail, such as the border on the bottom hem, are nice touches that made me feel better about the price.  I'm sure I could have gotten one less expensive but I'm positive it wouldn't have been as nice.  The dress also held up for 4 wearings - Halloween dance at school, party at karate, parade at school and Halloween night.
B0017QA98O,5.0,I paired this dress with ruby slippers I found at Target and a basket and stuffed animal dog to make the most adorable Dorothy! The dress is really cute and has a crinoline underneath which adds to the look and quality. Worth the price.
B0017QA98O,5.0,Wasn't sure about what size to get. Daughter is 3 and 37" and 33lbs.  The XS firt perfectly with room to grow.  Perfect costume no cheap stuff here.  Daughter LOVES it and wont take it off.  Skip the rest of the Dorothy costumes you are looking at.  This is THE one!!!!!!!
B0017QA98O,4.0,My daughter liked the costume, but she said it was a bit itchy. She looked really cute in it, though!
B0017QA98O,5.0,I bought this for my daughter's Wizard of Oz themed 4th birthday party, after extensively researching all the other options on the web and also in stores.  I was very wary as have bought some costumes that have turned out to be pretty cheap and nasty off the Internet in the past few years!  We are both really delighted with this one. It is outstanding quality in both fabric and construction, more like a proper dress than a dress up costume. The satin and cotton used are both thick and excellent quality, the cut is lovely and the finishing is professional. The edging sequins look subtle and add a bit of sparkle rather than being trashy. There are no itchy inside edges or tight sleeves, a previous costume issue. . It looked gorgeous and really authentic, and was also not too short. Sizing would be just right for the average 4-6 year old, my daughter is very tall for 4 (110 cm) and it fits her with a little room to grow.
B0017QA98O,3.0,This is a giant costume- at least 4T.  My daughter, who is just about done with 2T, was swimming in it.  There were a lot of frayed seams and loose threads that I had to snip and pull out before she could wear it.  I also didn't like that the back was plain.  I'll keep it for another halloween when she's bigger, but I thought there were better choices out there than this.
B0017QA98O,5.0,A pleasant surprise was the quality of this costume for the reasonable price.  Also fit was spot on.  My &#34;Dorothy&#34; received Distinction for her speech and drama exam :)
B0017QA98O,4.0,The dress is cute and appears to be well made. It is a bit plain though. For the price of the costume, I would have liked matching hair bows to be included.
B0017QA98O,5.0,My daughter got so many compliments and attention wearing this costume on Halloween!!!!!! I feel this is one of the best Dorothy costume ever!!!!!!
B0017QA98O,5.0,Bought this for my 3yo's birthday as she is a new Wizard of Oz fanatic. This was THE HIT of the day. She wears it constantly and her 4yo sister will fight her for it. Would buy this again 100x over, it is perfect for their dress-up box. Love, love it!
B0017QA98O,4.0,Good quality dress,  cute.We bought size LG 10-12 for our 7 year old daughter. She is currently wearing size 10 T-shirts; this dress was a bit on the loose side, but it was good because she will be able to use it for another year or 2.The skirt part is very well done and it keeps a good volume and texture, making the outfit look better than the usual you buy in costume stores. The back of the top part is made of a bit cheaper material, but it does not impact negatively the overall look.As the fabric is thin and she wore it in cold nights, she had to wear it with a white long sleeve under shirt - but it did not look funky. At the oposite, we got lots of compliments and the BW photos look as they were from the original movie! (We also bought a wig and the red slipers).
B0017QBIUC,5.0,The shoes fitted well. Light weight. I like the bottom of it. Sticks well to any surface.
B0017QBIUC,4.0,I am reviewing the silver/carbon/blue version.It's quite a comfortable sneaker with just enough contrasting colours to make the design eye catching but not over stated.Can be used by persons with wide feet.The only problem I foresee with this sneaker is that the silver portion is made of a soft smooth "leather" type material which could lead to easy wear and tear if the shoe is worn carelessly.Verdict: Buy.
B0017QBIUC,2.0,After running with these shoes for about a month, the upper is already showing obvious signs of tear. The shoes look and feel great but the upper should have been made with meche instead of this cheap plastic that cannot last long. I guess they Reebok couldn't make it both supple and durable. I am not sure these shoes will last a year even if I wear them moderately.
B0017QBIUC,4.0,Well, these shoes are just great. I've used them for a long time for running, walking and cross country and they adapt to any occasion. The air flows through the shoes, making your feet feel less sweaty. But they have a little flaw: the front part of the show eventually unglue and make the shoes look hideous.
B0017QBIUC,4.0,My only complaint is that the shoe is constructed on the narrow side, so it took a few days of breaking in to get used to them, but the support is amazing, and the heel cup is very forgiving.  I have used them only for walking and running, but I am setting up a heavy bag in the garage, and the springiness of these shoes should work well with a boxing workout.
B0017QBIUC,2.0,I have to say the shoe isn't so great in person. The uppers are a very fake feeling synthethic. Padding is basic and nothing spectacular. I think the look of the shoe is quite gimicky and when you see it in person you realize the little lines across the toe section of the foot are actual ' cut outs ' of the shoe which reveal the other colored fabric underneath. I'd recommend looking for the shoe in a store and checking it out first before you buy it.
B0017QBIUC,5.0,The best running shoes I've owned in more than a year. Very comfortable and stand up to the moderate to heavy use I put them through very well. I run 6-9 miles aweek on mostly gravel roads.
B0017QCAGS,3.0,HEX TRUE COMMENTS:It looks great.This shoe has a SOFT sole.The shoe is thin.Runs true to size in length.
B0017QCAGS,3.0,Its ok for a gentle usage but a bit uncomfortable for the quick and highly athletic guys. Not so good looking as it looks in the picture. Not enough cushion. The sole looked like it had a lot of cushion but does not serve its purpose.
B0017QD01M,3.0,I liked the ring looks good but the only issue is the sides are pretty thick so by any chance someone shakes your hand or you are trying to lift something.  The fingers on both sides gets crushed.  If one wants the ring make sure the sides are thin where the other fingers presses and you will love this ring.
B0017QDEQS,5.0,Costume fit great.. i wear a size 6-8 normally... i got a lot of compliments at the halloween party.. orange wig..was hair material.. fit great..
B0017QDEQS,4.0,Costume came great. I did have to exchange a size because the medium was more like a large. After that the fit was good it stayed in place. the wig was very small though and didn't even cover to my ears. the dress is see through so have a slip.
B0017QDEQS,3.0,The dress is cute but way too big. I bought a medium and I'm 5'6&#34; 145lb. It might be good in case it's cold on Halloween I can add some layers under. The necklace is plastic and uncomfortable. The wig is a pretty color and style but it just doesn't flow right.
B0017QDEQS,3.0,My biggest problem with it is that it is VERY straight - not form fitting at all so I had to wear a belt to make me look like I had a waist.  It is also shorter than I had thought it would be.  Overall, it is cute though.  The wig is great.
B0017QDEQS,5.0,This costume arrived very quickly. there was a slight tear in the seam at the shoulder, one that can be fixed easily. Very good for the price, Thank you!
B0017QDEQS,5.0,Item was exactly as described.The size runs a little big. I received the costume very quickly. The Wilma costume was very much worth the money I paid. It is great paired with the Fred Flintstone costume for Halloween.
B0017QDEQS,1.0,The costume was too big for the product sizing chart.The dress was made of fleece with a single piece of what looked like zebra print fabric for the border. The edges weren't finished.The necklace was white plastic balls, and the elastic didn't stretch enough to get over my head.The wig was far too small to cover my own hair.The product wasn't at all worth the price, even if it did fit. I returned it.
B0017QDEQS,4.0,I liked this costume alot. For halloween this year we got a group together to do a flintstones theme. All of the costumes were adorable but this one was really cute! The dress was a really good fit too.
B0017QDEQS,4.0,Product arrived on time (even with problems with fedex). Costume fit well and was good condition. Already wore it for a halloween at disney world and it was a hit.
