The size of the watch is a tad smaller than the (basic) DW-6900, so for those who have small wrists this might not be bad at all.I am in my 40s and I've been wearing G-Shocks since high school, first with the 5600 (the bezel cracked after 4 years and I didn't know one could replace it) and then the 5700 (which worked fine for 5 years, only that I wanted the newer G-shocks that were coming out) and since 1996 a DW 6600 (which I still wear). The only reason I got this new (for me, at least) is because I started liking analog movements. And although all those models fitted me just fine, the smaller G100 just fits me better.The watch takes patience to set, and having to change the time at least twice a year (because of day lights savings) I can see how some users would be put off. The watch is keeping excellent time, I synced it with an atomic clock the day I got it and it is about 3 second off (the watch is behind).I do miss the second's hand, but don't think it merits a lower star rating for it.

Great G Shock watch!  Upon reading other reviews, was surprised to see what others were complaining about and how they've had somewhat a bad experience with this particular design?  Some were saying they didn't like it because the watch straps were pulling hairs around their wrist?  Hasn't happened to me?  They must be really hairy for them to experience discomfort?  If you're a fan of G Shock watches, then this might be one for you as well.  I noticed several other reviews saying they were having problems with the \"Ani-Digi\" design when changing the time on the first and second hand.  Some were frustrated because when you normally change the time on a watch that has a first and second hand, we're probably used to being able to move the hands forward and backwards.  On this particular watch, you can only move it forward to get to the desired time when you are setting it.  Since we're accustomed to a \"twisting\" motion of a knob to either move the first and second hands forward or backward to set the time, you'll have to press and hold down one of the buttons to chance the time.  Example, if it's 2:30pm and you went through daylight savings time and need to go back to 1:30pm, set time, and press and hold until both first and second hands cycle and set to 1:30pm.  It's not that hard to sit there and watch the hands move, but will it take more than a few minutes to watch the hands pass every hour, yes.  If you're an impatient person, then this watch isn't for you.  It this hard to do, no.

I recently purchased this watch a couple days ago. The delivery was timely. This watch has rugged, yet clean aesthetics. With respect to the looks, I hate the dumb second circle which is on virtually every other g shock watch. It really detracts from the G shock series in my opinion.This model looks good. I would never say it looks cheap.Complaints:1. Yes, the digital part could have a slightly better contrast. It can be hard to read the digital readout during the evenings or under low light. This is solved by the EL backlight, which in my opinion is very clear.2. Adjusting the analogue time has been a complain, but it's not a big deal. I did a timed test with the stopwatch feature to see how long it would take me to do a complete rotation. I fumbled around pressing the very recessed button and it took me 4min. This is not a big deal considering the number of times one actually adjusts the time on a watch (which would be a real problem). The recessed button makes it difficult to accidentally change the time. A good feature according to me.On yes, let's not forget the hands blocking the digital portion. It depends when one is using the stopwatch and how important it really is at that particular moment to be running the stopwatch. This is where the ugly g shock watches (most) score.Size: I have smaller wrists and this fits me very well. A friend of mine who has a thicker wrist also owned the same model (before it was stolen, not destroyed, if that's what you're thinking) and he had no problems wearing it.This watch realistically has two time zones (2 digital 1analogue). The analogue cannot be considered a 3rd because the date will change according to the digital readout. There is no date on the other &#34;dual time&#34;I really wish this watch had a timer (3 stars sorry) . Of course, it wouldn't hurt if this watch used a 10 yr. battery ;) (4stars).Instructions are easy to follow and the manual is well laid out.Casio really does a good job trying to incorporate some slick technology into their watches.

I hadn't really considered g shocks till recently when my brother got one. I just needed something simple to wear while biking and this watch was in my price range. I opted for the used one cause I called amazon and they said it was just the box that was damaged. I figured it's a g shock so the watch should be fine. I was right, the watch was brand new and looked like it had never been worn or damaged, just the cardboard case was damaged. I tried finding a better price for this watch and amazon was the best. All my future g shock purchases will be with amazon!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2013", "summary": "Great buy!"}

I like the stying and size very much. I like that it has a dual time zone.  The only minor drawaback is that the digital readout is very hard to read for two reasons--one is that the letters and numbers are gray against a black background.  It takes thought to realize this as my brain (everyone's?) tries to see black numbers/letters against a gray background.  The second reason is the contrast between gray and black isn't great.  Sure I can use the light but that takes energy. I still like tha watch enough to keep it.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2010", "summary": "Hard to readdigital dial"}
