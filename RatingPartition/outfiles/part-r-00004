I'm a clinical psychologist with 3 offices [and a home office] so I tend to carry around a lot of junk, including charts, other papers etc. and with the Bucket Boss I'm no longer always rooting around trying to find something that I tossed in there.

It has tons of pockets, places for pens, wallet, checkbook...you name it. I've used it for over a month now and I can't find anything I'd change in the design, nor any flaws in the construction. In fact, I love it so much that I'm going to order a \"replacement\" now, so that when I wear this one out I'll have one already.

I also wanted them to have a nice appearance and not look like dedicated work suspenders. These were the only ones to fit that criteria for me. The brownish burgundy color is very rich and the chrome buckles and hardware look nice and function well. I had no problem adjusting these suspenders. The range is very accommodating from small to large. They can quickly and easily be attached and removed once the loop attachments are installed on your belt by using the clasps, for bathroom breaks and such. Four loop attachments are included (one kit). I actually bought these for casual wear so I removed the heavy shoulder pads. The process is easy. (1) unbuckle both front straps. (2) slide the horizontal chest strap down and off. (3) slide the shoulder pads off. (4) reinstall the chest strap and make up the buckles. Done. You could also slide them off the back by removing that round strap guide (thing) which is the way I did it because the chest strap was so tight, I did not think that it was made to slide. It has since loosened up some. In the picture the horizontal chest strap appears to be riveted on but on my pair you can slide it and adjust the height. It is tight and requires some force to move, so it does not flop around. I would have prefered a chest strap that attached with clamps, (clamps that would not scar the leather). Mine uses leather attachment loops. These could potentialy become loose as the leather stretches, to the point where the strap might fall down, but I could be wrong. They seem a little expensive. When you break them down into their seperate components, there is not a lot to them that you could not pick up at the local hardware store for a few bucks, but what are you going to do, make them yourself, c'mon. They were delivered fast right to my front door by Fed Ex, I think it was Fed Ex. They can be a little restricting but that is the nature of suspenders, I guess. I recently removed the chest strap which makes them less restricting and more comfortable. As they break in and soften I can foresee them becoming very comfortable. These are the first pair of suspenders that I have owned and I really like them. Everything I wrote is truthful to my experierce. Yours may be completely different. If it is, I'm sorry.

The ability to tranport the favorite bits from my music collection with me is a Godsend. The 6 GB Nomad Jukebox was therfore a must-have product.I havn't been disappointed. The Playcentre 2 software makes ripping your cd's and transferring mp3 files a breeze, although it is annoying (but not surprising) that two-way transfer isn't possible.I find the player navigation really easy to use. I would suggest that some of the other reviewers havn't played around with their menus yet. Contrary to reports, there is a facility whereby the active queuelist can be randomly played. The stop key also acts as a pause button which is obviously useful if listening to audiobooks.The headphones look smart and produce a good sound. I would agree however that the EAX sound system is gimmicky and those with a keen ear may be disappointed.Despite my minor quibbles, I have to come back to the fact that on my system I currently have 1250 of my favorite songs with room for more. This sort of portability was a fantasy until this player came along.If you want your music on the move the positive points of the Nomad Jukebox more than outweigh the negatives.

It stores 6 GB of music with intuitive navigation of its  various screens and the 20 hours of preloaded music allow easy appreciation  of its  great features and a great chance to play with its bells and  whistles before I ripped my own music. Additional CD's ripped and  transferred to it sound just as great (ripped at 128 kb).  The Play Center  2 Software allows easy transfer from the CD or downloaded from the internet  and can be transferred to either your music Library on the Hard Drive, the  Jukebox, or some destination on MY Computer. The biggest challenge with  Play Center 2 is managing all those windows of track information. Ripping  and transferring to the Jukebox takes 10 -15 minutes per CD.It comes  with 2 sets of Nickel-Metal Hydride rechargable batteries, good-sounding  Creative back headphones, an AC Adapter-Charger and a USB Cable.  I like  the fact that you can also record by microphone or by jack from an external  analog source in wave format to be converted by computer into MP3 and  uploaded back to the Jukebox.Unlike some MP3 Players, the volume at the  maximum is more than sufficient.  I love the EAX effects that simulate  Concert Hall or other environments controlled by whatever percentage you  choose.  The ability to upgrade will allow support for the infrared slot  and other future music formats.On the downside, the weight is heavier  than that of a CD player and it is not suitable for jogging in spite of the  5 minute buffer.

I have the original 6 gig model, but last I checked, it's upgradable to 60 gigs, since it uses a standard laptop harddrive, which can be changed. I've found 6 gigs to be plenty for when I'm on the go, and use my Nomad primarily in my taxi, where I hook it's line output to the line input on my older Pioneer car stereo.  It's truly perfect for 12 hour shifts as a cab driver, and my passengers love it too. The sound is nothing short of awesome if you have good sounding mp3s, since it's sound hardware is basically a SoundBlaster Live. The firmware is upgradable too, so this player can adapt to new file formats as they're introduced in the future.In order to fully appriciate this player, you should already have a sizable mp3 library. Mine was up to about 120 gigs when I bought my Nomad Jukebox last year.  Realise, it will take you a while to get 6 gigs of mp3s into it with USB.  Once you fill it up though, it's a real pleasure to remove the songs you're tired of and add more new ones.The Playcenter 2 software that ships with the Nomad Jukebox is completely awful; so bad I nearly returned mine shortly after I bought it. There are much better programs for making mp3s which I of course already had.  Fortunatly, there is also other software available for the Nomad, so you don't have to use the wreched PlayCenter software at all. I've been using Notmad Explorer from Redchair Software for almost a year with my Nomad, and love it.  Notmad (for Windows) integrates into Windows Explorer and makes moving files to and from the Nomad Jukebox via USB as easy as copying them to another harddrive, and gives network support that as far as I could tell was absent in PlayCenter.  Notmad Explorer also lets you create and edit your playlists so you don't have to do it with the tiny bottons and screen on the player.  It also has the ability to edit the ID3 tags of the files on the Nomad Jukebox, a crucial feature that PlayCenter lacks.The most amazing feature of the Nomad Jukebox, which I rarely see mentioned, is not only is it a player, it's also a recorder, and an exceptional one at that. Using it's analog audio input, It makes recordings that put to shame anything I've EVER heard before. It records to 16-bit wave files at either 44k (CD quality) or 48k (slightly higher DAT quality). I've been using it to digitally record my vinyl and cassettes, and have also made amazing recordings of concerts and band jam sessions with it. The wave files I easily move to a PC with Notmad Explorer to edit and compress into mp3s. I've been making mp3s from analog sources with PCs since 1999, and the quality of the mp3s made from wave files recorded with the Nomad Jukebox are so good it's stunning. I've been collecting records since 1973, so this feature is really a dream come true. Oddly enough, it lacks an input level meter, but the recording level is adjustable, so with a little trial and error you can get it perfect.Another perk is that the Nomad Jukebox runs on 12 volts DC; perfect for using in a car. The included rechargable batteries are only good for about 3 hours, but they're standard AA batteries, so as better battery technology develops, this too can improve. I'm amazed how many people complain about this, as all things considered, three hours of playback is very good. Few laptops will play mp3s this long on thier batteries, and additional batteries for the Nomad are much cheaper than any laptop battery by a long shot.The EAX feature that's so hyped I've found to be a complete waste.  Why add cheezy echo delay effects to a player that without them sounds excellent?No, the Nomad Jukebox is not very suitable for active use (jogging, snowboarding, etc), but it's really not intended for that. I have found it to be perfect for bicycle riding around town, as long as the ride is under two hours. I also use it while riding the bus and walking. The supplied carrying case is pretty useless, but since the Nomad Jukebox is roughly the size of a portable CD player, it wasn't hard to find a nice suitable case for it with a strap and room for it's cables.The complaints about CDDB file naming issues really amuse me. It's a user-submitted database, of course it's riddled with errors. Am I the only person left that's not too lazy to type in my own ID3 tags? This is very easy to do with Winamp before uploading the files to the Nomad. One note about ID3 tags: use ID3v1, not ID3v2 if you care about continous play albums, otherwise you'll hear a pause in the music as the Nomad Jukebox changes tracks. This is because ID3v1 uses the mp3 file header, and ID3v2 appends itself to the end of the file, making the mp3 slightly larger, enough to cause a pause. The Nomad Jukebox is the ONLY player I've seen that will not insert a pause between files, but only if there are no ID3v2 tags. Those are easily removed with Winamp as well. I know some people prefer WMA to mp3, but personally I'm not impressed.In short, the Nomad Jukebox is a remarkably good portable audio component if used with third party software and accessories. It's much more than merely an mp3 player, and well worth every penny. Unlike other mp3 devices, it's fully upgradable, and should never really be obselete. I've nearly stopped burning CDs since I got it, since I can hook my Nomad Jukebox up to nearly any stereo or amplified speakers. I've yet to see a better way to take a large amount of music with you. Sure, the iPod is smaller, but it's features don't even compare to the Nomad Jukebox. Once you've made the jump to this harddrive based player, memory based ones seem laughably limited, and carrying CDs with you, even mp3-CDs, seems silly.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2003", "summary": "I've had my Nomad Jukebox a year, and absolutely love it!"}

No sir!I have been using the nearest product to a competitor for monthes... the Personal Jukebox 100 from Han-Go electronics, both the 4.68 and 6.4gig versions. The Creative Nomad JB is by far a better developed, more feature laden product. It has many, many improvements over the PJB-100 including the excellent software that allows you to cue up an unlimited number of MP3 tracks to transfer then go away while the USB chugs along. The PJB-100 makes you go in small bunches of tracks a directory at a  time then puts them in Alphabetical order no matter the album order. The only way to preserve order in the PJB-100 is to rip directly to the unit which leaves no MP3 on your computer, and is slower than a modern PC as well.By comparison the Nomad preserves album order by default and organizes automatically by Playlist, Album, Artist, and Genre. The PJB requires you to make playlists when transferring from the PC by making 'copies' of the tracks on the unit. These take up no space but you can't manipulate the playlists except when connected to the PC. The Nomad lets you do all this easily with the unit itself, a much better method.Battery life... The PJB-100 lasts 12 full hours of continuous use on a charge of its Lithium Ion battery. The Nomad claims 4 hours but this is dependant upon many other factors. Like how well behaved the Nickel Metal-Hydride batteries are. This is the kind that has a 'memory' and degrades rapidly if not completely exhausted, then completely charged. The normal use pattern of this sort of unit means this isn't going to happen. I feel that Creative's including a second set is more ominous than friendly. And they warn on several labels and stickers to use Only Creative NiMh batteries as replacements even though they are nominally the same as any other 1.2 volt, AA form rechargable except in that NimH and Nicads have different discharge curves. I do not choose to experiment with a widget this expensive. And at any rate the unit is best suited for staionary, home use where it can remain plugged in.The PJB-100 has a car kit. This is a BAD thing. In use one failed with a broken line out jack... it only has ONE! Even after getting warranty repairs the unit failled again only weeks later from HD death. This time out of warranty. The second unit started making model helicopter noises when the HD runs so it lives in semi retirement at home now. We will see how well the Nomad likes the highways but I suspect it will stand up to the vibration and bouncing a little better. It is a sturdier sort of creature to be sure.EAX effects... yawn. You can distort and twist your music in a wide variety of fashions. I use MP3 to AVOID this. What would be usefull is Not included. That is Normalization. Using WinAmp you can have you choice of free normalization plug-ins. MusicMatch Jukebox used to have a normalization option but it never worked right and is now absent from the current version. CD's do not have equal levels... much less Mp3's ripped from them. Anyone who has listened to a playlist from many different CD's can recall turning up the volume to hear a quiet track then being blasted into next week by the next track from a louder Cd. This is also what keeps Windows Media Player 7 and RealPlayer from being usefull MP3 players.Still... I like everything about the design of this thing except the shape. The PJB-100 is squarish. At least it has a flat surface on the bottom and fits in a large pocket. The Nomad is CD player shaped sorta. But there is no convenient way to HOLD it. The PJB-100 comes with a case that shows it's display and exposes it's controls. The Nomad case cannot be used while playing it. No hole for the jack or controls. Just a bag. And it is not going in anyone's pockets. Again... much more suited to live on the shelf hooked into the stereo. The PJB-100 comes with a mini-plug to RCA phono-plug 'Y' cable to connect to the stereo. Not so the Nomad though it DOES have 2 lineouts and surround capability.

I had a Riovolt first but it was hopeless at playing CD-RW discs (yes it said CD-RW compatitable on the box), then I had an Archos 6000 that melted (literally) when it was charging.So purchasing the Nomad and its a dream come true. I can store 2500 96bit/sec high quality WMA files (WMA is better than MP3), arrange the songs into albums, genres, artists and playlists, which is a godsend when looking up a specific song or to play songs in a specific order. One feature which is so handy that it brought tears to my eyes, is the ability to add songs to the active playlist as you go, without interupting the current song playing. The included software is easy to use and enables CD ripping, organizing and titleing of your favourite songs. It only takes a few moments to transfer a lot of files through the included USB lead.The unit itself is a very sleek silver-blue affair that has high-quality fixtures, positive-acting buttons and a very clear backlit LCD that has a very easy-to-understand menu system, backed up by 3 navigation buttons that aid you through the menus. The drive unit itself is very quiet and smooth and is responsive when navigating songs.The unit has oodles of sound-tweaking modes such as a graphic equaliser, environment settings and stereo wide modes, but even in normal mode, the unit sounds so damn good you'll hardly use the sound modes. Hook it up to your stereo via its Line out and the sound quality is amazing, it rivals a CD player.Some customers complain that the unit 'skips' but I don't have a habit of bashing my Nomad on the floor and when its safely tucked away in my pocket, it never ever skips when im walking or running. Also the battery life is very acceptable (I can squeeze 6 hours out of mine) if you follow the charging procedures, and in fairness to Creative Labs, you do get 2 packs of NimH batteries. What more do you want?!Overall this player is so damn good if it was a woman i'd marry it and I hope to keep this player for many years to come, (its THAT good) :-)", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2002", "summary": "If this Nomad was a woman i'd marry it!"}

If the advertised four hours is &quot;low battery life&quot;, then battery life is low; however, understanding the power requirements of the device, I am pleased with the battery life.  Since batteries recharge in the device, even while it's playing (albeit more slowly), I don't often discharge the batteries, and I carry spares anyway.  Creative ships two sets of rechargable batteries with the player.  I've also used Eveready Ni-MH rechargables and recharged the Creative batteries in an Eveready charger without a hitch.  Rechargables slowly discharge even if you don't use them, so you should recharge spares occassionally.Booting the device takes 10-15 seconds.  It's a little irksome, at times, but it's quite tolerable.  Clearly, faster response time is always better.  Once the device is booted, it responds quickly in my experience.  I'd like to see a more effective album/title search feature, like a bisection search.  Ideally, I'd see the first and last titles in the first half of a list followed by the first and last titles in the last half of the list, then I'd pick the half of the list I want to search further, and so on.I've had few problems with portability.  Using a carrying case designed for a portable CD player, I've walked the streets and bladed with the device.  I wouldn't worry about biking with it either.  If I were a runner, I'd use a solid state device and live with its limited capacity while running, but I'm very happy with the portability of the Jukebox.  I had a minor fall while blading with the device, and it held up nicely, not even a skip.  Understanding the potential for disk head crash, I don't recommend too much rough and tumble.  On the other hand, I bought the extended warranty.I don't understand the volume gripes, but I haven't destroyed my hearing with heavy metal yet, either.  Wynonna is more my speed.  The volume meter varies from 1 through 20, and I like 12 in a quiet setting.  The default is 16, and I find that setting a little loud.  I don't understand the headphone gripes either, but I'm not a phonophile.  The sound quality seems better than the headphones I had used with my portable Philips CD player.I'm aware of one competitive device, the Archos Jukebox 6000.  It also features a 6 gb hard drive, usb connection, some EAX-like features and generally seems a lot like the Nomad, but it looks very different, rectangular like a portable cassette player.  It has a smaller cache, only 2MB, not enough for an entire song, compared with 8MB on the Nomad...The only other portable mp3 player I'd consider at this point is one of the portable CDRW devices with mp3 playback.  Some of those devices also play standard CDs.  A 6 gig drive will probably hold all the music I'll ever want in one place at one time, so I like the hard drive approach, but I'd definitely hate to deal with a disk crash.  I've seen a nice looking CDRW device with mp3 playback and an 8MB cache from Sony...  I didn't notice if it played standard CDs, and I suspect it would burn an mp3 file on a CDW much more slowly than the Nomad writes its hard drive.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox has a secret it isn't telling.  Someday, soon, it will morph into a handheld/wearable, general purpose computer, or a peripheral for a palmtop at least.  The next Nomad will probably have a 20 gig drive, but something bigger and better is always six months away these days.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2001", "summary": "Three thumbs up"}

Those two songs were the very first songs that Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis produced as well as the very first songs in their long 30 year resume although they were not hit singles.

Jam and Lewis also cooked up the slightly toned down \"The Man in My Life\" and retain their sassiness with the defiant, \"All Turned Out\"  Due to the fact that Mr Griffey focused more on Shalamar and The Whispers, this album was largely ignored as well the album has been crafted and it took the girls 2 more years to make themselves a household name with their massive hit album, Meeting in the Ladies Room.  Although the girls handled their own instruments (with some help), the production was all handled by either Jam & Lewis or Lakeside (except that Bernadette Cooper co-produced \"Heartbreaker\") which was probably a good thing to avoid overkill.

Songs can be put in track order, and the data transfer rate jumped from 500k to over 3m.I love this device, and don't know how I lived with my Rio 500 (even with an extra 64 meg card) for so long.

I have over 20 gigs in my personal collection right now, so there is NO WAY I'm going to be able to &quot;Take my whole CD collection with me&quot; as everyone says, but I can take a big chunk of it with me.

The Remote Solution 6 gig is still(much more), and it doesn't look anywhere as cool as this beauty. And it's lacking IR, and Line In recording.

Keep in mind it comes with two sets of batteries, so if you carry both around you have  about 8 hours.  The reason for the low battery life is that you are running a hard drive!  If you mainly use this kind of thing at the home or in the car, there is a AC adapter and I believe Creative has just released a car kit.Another complaint is the loudness.  While it is not near soft, it is not quite as loud as a CD player usually achieves.  For me, however, it is usually not a problem.  I have found that the SoundJam program (comes with the player) lets you raise the sound of any track when you rip the CD's to mp3.Here is one great part about the Jukebox - free upgrades from the website!

Jean's biggest hits during the period covered by this box of five CD's (up to 1964) included A dear John letter (a #1 duet with Ferlin Husky), Forgive me John (a reply to the previous hit, also with Ferlin), A satisfied mind, Beautiful lies and Second fiddle to an old guitar. All other hits - indeed everything Jean recorded up to the end of 1964 - can also be found here.During this period, Jean was often overshadowed by two other country queens, Kitty and Patsy, but Jean played an important role in gaining recognition for female singers of country music. Jean often sang hard-hitting songs about relationships which would have feminists cheering her on (as Kitty also did, most famously with It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels), a great example being Two whoops and a holler. In this song, Jean demands to know why men can be unfaithful and it's OK, but if a woman does that, she's lower than a hound. Of course, that was the fifties and a few things have changed since then. Jean's feisty side is also evident on several other tracks here.The overall feel of the set is typical fifties honky-tonk country, including cover versions of songs made famous by Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell, Jim Reeves and others - but there are not many songs here which are really famous. I was surprised at just how few such songs Jean recorded during this time.The best known songs here are I can't stop loving you, I love you because, You win again, Mockin' bird hill, If you've got the money I've got the time and I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes (which has the same tune as Wild side of life and It wasn't god who made honky tonk angels), although you will recognise others.Jean has a lovely voice (described by another reviewer as a sweet but full-bodied alto - I can't improve on that), which I find to be much easier on the ear than Kitty's, while her music is much more firmly rooted in country than Patsy's. Jean is truly one of a kind - there will never be another like her.If you are thinking of buying this, you are obviously a huge fan of traditional country music, and you are probably familiar with Jean's music already. If you only want a little of Jean's music, there are other single-CD compilations that will satisfy your needs.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2002", "summary": "Fifties country music at it's finest"}

The neck cord is adjustable so it can be easily made to fit anyone. I found this pouch easier to use than the ones you wear across your waist because I was able to access it either by pulling it down below my shirt or up through the top of my shirt (whichever was easier with the shirt I was wearing).

It came in very good quality and looks exactly as pictured. I have worn it and have had very many compliments on how authentic to Tifa's it looks. I plan on wearing it to Sakura Con this up coming year.The only thing to remember when buying this is to pay close attention to the measurements and make sure that you have yourself measured properly. The above measurements are spot on and dont go buying the next size up because you think they are going to be too small. Other cosplay costumes do run small because the measurements are lost in translation, this one is accurate. I actually purchased the larger one just in case and it came very much too big.

Some reviews listed under this item are about different Pathfinder Protrek watches without the analog hands which I never seriously considered.  Analog dials have a great advantage - you can take a split-second glimpse and still know what time it is, and combined with digital dials they give you an abundance of available readings.  I have been looking for and buying only ana-digi watches like this because of their functionality and flexibility.The greatest selling point of this watch is the perfect combination of features that I am always looking for (listed in order of importance):- Analog-digital multi-function watch- Solar- Shock-resistant- Compass- Barometer- AltimeterSo far, I have been very proudly using this watch every day for two and a half years and it is still my #1 functionality-features watch in the world.  Although it's not listed as anti-shock but as \"Tough Solar\" it really is a very tough engineering work of art.  It still works perfectly even though it has gone through a significant number of abusing events.  Besides the annual vacation swims/dives in the sea and everyday normal movements, I'm an ex professional drummer who still frequently pats his knees in the rhythm of the music, and nowadays this watch has to withstand frequent clapping when listening to the music and playig with my daughter.  In addition, my 1.5 year old daughter used to play with it occasionally and she let it fall on the floor many times.  Moreover, this watch has two times received a hit that would have broken apart any other watch I have.  Once I accidentally hit a corner of a rock wall with it so hard that my hand hurt.  In spite of my expectations, all those abuses have only left a single barely visible scratch in the middle of the glass and several minor scratches on the bezel, so I can testify that the crystal/glass on it is very scratch resistant and the watch really is very tough.  I bought the titanium model/bracelet, so the entire watch is very light in spite of its size.The solar charging works great and the battery is almost always on H (high) position, and only in December during long nights and short days it sometimes goes to M (medium) and the contributing factor might be that I have the automatic backlight set up and it frequently lights up even when I don't need it.  When I get the M reading I can quickly charge the watch if I leave it in the window for half an hour during a sunny day because in the winter it is often covered with my sleeve when I'm outside.  Usually, instead of charging I like to push the envelope and see whether I can get it to L (low), but I've never seen that so far. At night and during prolonged low light conditions, the watch shuts off its digital displays to save power, but once you move the watch (or turn the backlight on), they turn on automatically and instantaneously.Some people complain about inaccurate temperature readings on watches like this, but you have to be aware that there is no way your watch will not get influenced by your body temperature, so you need to take it off and leave it for several minutes before you can get an accurate reading.  The only exception is when you are swimming/diving and you can obtain a reasonably accurate measurement of the water temperature in a matter of minutes without taking the watch off, especially if you are moving your arms and swimming or if water is otherwise flowing around the watch.The barometer/altimeter is accurate (of course, if you adjust it prior to your trip to a known reference point).  I always watch it on the airplane where you can tell which passenger plane keeps the air pressure best (or also which company is trying to save and scrape on air supplies and maintain low pressure)  - sometime you'll see the pressure drop about 33% before they adjust it and so the reading of the altimeter in a pressurized plane cabin is not at all accurate.  The internal artificial pressure they keep in the passenger cabin usually corresponds to 4000-6500 feet above the sea level.The compass function works well, but I think they should have allowed it to work for a longer and possibly adjustable period of time before shutting itself off automatically after 20 seconds.  I know it takes a considerable amount of battery power to run the compass but still, I'd like to have the option to run it for 30 seconds or a minute without having to press the button repeatedly.There is more I'd like to see and buy in a better watch and I have been looking for it for years, but I still haven't seen one as good as this.The only two main competitors I considered for a while were Tissot's T-Touch and Citizen's Eco-Drive Skyhawk.  The T-Touch watch, as seen in the James Bond movie is a bit less bulky and more dressy, so it looks better, but you have to spend about double the amount on it.  Still, if it were solar I wouldn't hesitate to buy it, but since it's not, in my referent system that translates to a waste of time and money when the battery runs out and a questionable water resistance after replacement, so it's out of the question.  Citizen's similar solar bulky watch Eco-Drive Skyhawk is a bit more dressy, but its digital and analog dials are not independent and from some reviews I can also conclude that it's definitely not as tough and resistant as this one.  Omega had an amazing ana-digi multi-function Speedmaster X-33 watch that was a serious candidate for my favorite, however, that one was not solar powered, it was many times more expensive, and it is not being made any more, so Casio's PRG60T-7V still owns the \"THE WATCH\" title in my world.Some minor cons:- I'm 6'3\" and not skinny, and although together with the titanium bracelet it does have a rugged sturdy look, I'd like it to be a bit smaller, and definitely thinner.- Position of start/stop/reset buttons on the stop watch function is unusual.  The lower right button is used to start and stop and the upper right is used to reset (I'm used to the opposite).- The color of the first circular layer under the bezel (I suppose this is the solar charging part) is gray but in some light it gets an ugly-ish  purple shade- It takes a long time to circle almost 12 hours if your watch is one minute fast because I can only adjust the hands forward.  Fortunately, the watch is pretty accurate and I only do this several times a year, two  times because of the DST switch.Things I would like to see in a future improved model:- Atomic world-wide time adjustments- Count down timer.All in all, this is as good as it gets. I have been searching for a better watch for years, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2008", "summary": "I can't find a better watch"}

I love this Titanium Pathfinder because it does so many things well and has an equally impressive appearance. The Titanium Pathfinder functions in a very similar manner to my original one, with some additional timers for yacht racing.  The main reason I bought this watch was my desire to own a good quality all metal Triple Sensor Pathfinder.  I was stunned to find this one on Amazon and at a price which was lower than I paid for the first one.  I became immediately interested because the components (case and wristband) are Titanium.  Titanium is the hottest metal going for all types of consumer goods including watches and appliances (like my refrigerator).  Another new feature for me was the solar powered movement.  My only disappointment is that it doesn't include atomic timekeeping; however the error tolerance (+ or - 15 seconds/month) is the same for the atomic Pathfinder and the solar Pathfinder.  I believe Casio now makes a solar powered atomic Pathfinder but it is considerably more expensive.  It appears that this model is being discontinued so you need to act quickly.  I am sure its replacement will be considerably more costly.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2006", "summary": "Casio does it again for me"}

I had read a review and was trying to decide whether it would be worth it or not. Well it was, and I am very happy that I bought him this toy. It was totally worth every cent to see his face light up when I showed him this magic trick for the first time. I showed him the hidden space inside the hat and within about two minutes he was off showing everyone his new magic hat. He told his grandma see theres nothing in there and then waved his hand over the hat and said abera cadabera and pulled out the bunny. He was about 3 1/2 at the time and I was worried that he would be too young for the trick but he wasn't. He is now almost 5 and I just visited him a month ago and he still enjoyed showing me the hat trick. He even loved wearing the hat on his head and he was laughing the the whole time he played with the hat. I think it also helps with abstract thinking and the concept that something is still there even if you can't see it. It also is very impressive to friends when your child (or in my case my nephew) shows them the trick. It is adorable.

Her playdates, two who are closer to 3, are madly in love with the tutus--it's a good thing we only have one of them at a time. I think that it would ideally fit a 3 or 4 year old without any stretch, but could fit kids possibly up to the age of twelve with the amount of stretch it has. The elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft. After throwing it in the wash, the edges can curl a little with minimal fray--maybe I could have put it on a gentler cycle, but it looks pretty much lithe same. I really like the way the elastic is sewn in. The satin edge is part of the tulle fabric, not sewn on, and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge, making it seem pretty secure.

I see lots of Nicky Epstein's work style here. A great deal of color work, some delicate and some brighter. Some texture. In all quite a bit of variety, with great production values for the book itself.I would not recommend this for the beginner, unless you are really adventurous, or planning ahead to be an expert. There is little here to start off a new knitter safely. I would gather some good basic techniques and ensure that you don't have lots of bad habits first, before trying to tackle most of these.Some of the colorwork that looks really intimidating is simply duplicate stitch, so it's not nearly so difficult to  produce, but has impressive results. There are a couple of afghans here that would give me pause before tackling them, and I LIKE a challenge, so be warned.However, I think this is a fine book if you don't have lots of her other work in your collection. I had never seen any of these before, so I'm really pleased.I would caveat, though, that in my experience of working with her patterns before, to be really alert for what is on your needles v what is in the pattern. If in doubt, go with your needles. Also, I have nearly always found that she seems to prefer a much lighter fabric than I do, so I gauge down by at least 2 sizes, sometimes 3.

I would recommend learning at least the alphabet before starting, as that definitely helps the program make more sense. This actually comes with an alphabet guide, but you should probably use another source to learn it. Also, learning some grammar before starting could be of much use. I remember having absolutely no idea which choice to make on many of the grammar questions early on. This is alright, however, as you'll end up figuring it out mostly by using Rosetta Stone.As I'm an absolute beginner, I did like that Rosetta Stone just starts off with vocabulary. It gives a good feel for the pronunciation of words and other basic concepts. I must admit, though, that it was pretty scary to start the very beginning lesson with a near impossible-to-pronounce word, devushka (\"girl\" in the English alphabet). Aside from that, the program starts off nicely with vocab, and progresses to grammar and some basic conversation. It becomes even more complex once each core lesson (and then unit) is mastered. The \"standard\" course is perfect for learning the language overall, although there are different courses that can specifically focus on speaking, reading, or writing. There are also standard courses with different introductions, extended courses, and placement tests.Some people may not like Rosetta Stone's style of full immersion. I suppose it does make some parts difficult, but it also teaches you better than simple translations.I'd definitely recommend this product. I'm not even done using it yet, but it's taught me a lot of Russian and I will be getting the next levels.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2012", "summary": "Great for beginners"}

Levels 1-3 will give you a good foundation in the language and probably some fairly good speaking skills - but you will still have a ways to go. Also, sadly, you will not have developed very much conversational skills after this first level. You will learn some \"need-to-know\" stuff, yes, but stuff that you will most likely not use very much. There are sentences like \"The cat is in the hat\" and \"The keys are in the shoe\". I understand the reasoning behind forming sentences like this (prepositions and the prepositional case), but you would think that more focus would be paid on actual conversational skills.Another gripe is that the images are not unique to the language. You would think that if you pay over $200 bucks for one level (and over $500 for all three) that you would be getting something unique. Having said that, there is a wide range of different Russian speakers throughout level one - all very pleasant and easy to understand.The online features are absolutely great. This is one reason why it's earned four stars from me. I honestly think Rosetta Stone could really make some money if they separated the software and their online stuff.So, to sum everything up: this is a good, addictive, and interactive product; but it definitely shouldn't be your only resource. Buy some books to understand some of the grammar, and try to get yourself a dictionary or always have Google Translate handy and ready to go. Also, try to hook up with some native speakers via Skype or something, especially if you want to learn some real conversational skills. You can probably learn more in a few hours with a native speaker (when it comes to day-to-day conversations) than Rosetta Stone Russian level 1 will teach you.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2011", "summary": "Great!

Hoffman \"artist and musician\"", "helpful": [9, 10], "unixReviewTime": 1309305600, "reviewText": "ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language...naturally, quickly, without studying verb declention charts, memorizing vocabulary lists, or navagating grammatical oddities. However, there is an obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon. The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children. Any Linguist will tell you, children are hard wired to learn grammer, and to speak perfectly their native language. As we age, the ability to speak certain sounds disappears, and the ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears. Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally, or pronouncing certain native sounds, the door shuts. You can still learn, but not perfectly. This is why a russian who learns english, will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles. Also, this is why Russian constanant clusters are impossible to pronounce for English speakers. There are almost NO exceptions to this, except for language savants i suppose.However, as far as learning language in a natural way, on your own, ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do. As anyone knows who's studied foreign languages in high school or college, you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet. Then, you learn the most common words, along with the way basic verbs (TO BE, TO HAVE, TO KNOW, etc) are conjugated, how the nouns and adjectives interact, etc. ROSETTA STONE turns that learning process on its head, and the center of its do-it-yourself language class, is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system. The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your computer keyboard (in case your target language has a different alphabet, than the English alphabet), and the computer files, plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer. Also, the buyer recieves in the box, this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer.(plus a few simple instructions to get started.) Unlike the oldest voice recognition programs from a decade ago, this headset just sets the volumn level, and you are ready to go. Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet, you just learn to speak the first words a baby might speak...\"cat, run, read, boy, girl, hello, 1,2,3,4,5,6\", stuff like that. Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically, \"BY EAR\". First, not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear. Some musicians can hear a song, and they KNOW every chord they heard, and the notes, and can reproduce them instantly, because they can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR. Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument, and they need sheet music, and chord theory. WHY? Because some people are more right brain, others more left brain...maybe some people HEAR better, and others analyse better. So, if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word \"ZIA\" (Aunt), you will never GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah. When English speakers see a \"Z\", they will not pronouce \"TS\", as in German, Russian, Italian, etc. SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT THE ITALIAN \"Z\" OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE, you need to guess. THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work. You might hear TSEE-a, but if you see \"ZIA\", your brain will think it's hearing what it's used to hearing--\"ZEE-ah\", and that's what you will say. AND, the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation. Likewise, Italian has other sounds not at all like English, and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound, you may never get close to the correct sound. I have a good ear. But i couldn't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding \"D\" than english. I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the Italian language. At times, I would click on LANGUAGE LAB, where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word, as well as showing you the voice print, and how the native speaker's voice rises and falls naturally, during the pronounciation of the word. (Apparently for correct stress.) If you are 50% or less away from getting it right, you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are, to correct pronounciation. (Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word, so you can compair what you are saying, to that of a native speaker.) If your circle turns green, you are 80% or closer to perfect pronounciation. HOWEVER, this system DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. Once, i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes. I was UPSET, then angry, then bored, and finally, dejected. Frustration kills motivation, and I think that's why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people. IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation, at least i could TRY to figure out how to say it. I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point. The computer program doesnt say \"The Italian 'G' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G'.\" Instead, you are suppose to just KNOW this.  Sometimes, i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly. For example, ROSETTA STONE wants you to roll your R's. But, very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound. So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R's as a mistake in pronounciation. The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part, and at times the mistakes start to stack up. IF you dont get thru a lesson with a good score, you'll need to repeat the lesson, and also repeat the offending word. (the program tracks a LOT of parameters, including how long its been since you have taken a lesson. Too long, and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again. But that's good.) All I can say, is when I could not pronounce a certain word, i almost never knew why. Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice, if you've an inability to say a certain word, you might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem, was that there is NOTHING in the kit, that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school. Sometimes, those photos that go with the spoken or written exercise, dont get the idea across very well. THE ONLY SOLLUTION, is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book, that covers basics of grammer, pronounciation, vocabulary, and all the other holes in the learning of the language, that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced. AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book, very cheap, that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely. \"ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE\" by Cristina Mazzoni, for around $8 new. I bought that book, and only then, were the grammer lessons beginning to make sense. ALSO, this book spends time in the beginning, to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced, and the way the Italian Alphabet is pronounced. You NEED to get a book like this, so you understand italian grammer, and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other problems with ROSETTA STONE. Everybody says \"DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB, UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS\". Because, depending on how fast, or slow, you are motivated to move thru the lessons, those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast. WAIT TO SIGN UP! ALSO, its good to know that you cant just sign up for language lab a day or two before you want to use it. THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT, to have a lesson. Besides the speach recognition problem, and the lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer, pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language, everything about ROSETTA STONE's classes are LOTS OF FUN. Really. They have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind. There are stories that help with reading, that are clued into your number of finished lessons. ITALIAN LEVEL ONE, for example, is divided into UNIT ONE, language basics, UNIT TWO, Greetings, UNIT THREE, Work and school, UNIT FOUR, shopping. By the time you finish that much of the course, you should be able to get around Italy, and make basic conversation. I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN, or two years of high school italian, or 1-2 Italian grandparents. ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting, and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit (language basics), so long as you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software. I wish i had waited for the langauge lab, because i'm SURE that would have helped. However, if you don't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months, its only $25 a month, for more time with those online tutors. All things considered, VOICE RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well. I'm sure most of the problems people have, come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language, rather than the program's inability to understand your voice. If you are speaking the language correctly, I would guess anywhere from 96-99% of the time, ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say. If some word (like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI) comes up, you can easily skip the word. There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach, increase your vocabulary, and engage you in an \"immersion\" type language adventure, like ROSETTA STONE can.  NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab. The only REAL problem is if you learn on your own, its hard to keep your motivation for learning high. You'll need discipline and some kind of reward, ie, a trip to Italy if you finish LEVEL 1? (Or maybe just a FELLINI film. Whatever rocks your boat.) Good luck with your language adventure, and ARRIVIDERCI!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2011", "summary": "The EXASPERATION of SPEACH RECOGNITION"}

This series does a very thorough, professional, and entertaining job of introducing concepts, pronunciation, and culture to the user which makes it fun and intuitive to learn.  One aspect that all users of of this series should think of is the considerable amount of money you will save by taking the Rosetta Stone courses over university-taught courses.  I fully endorse the university experience to everyone, but one part of my education that I didn't appreciate was the way my foreign languages were crow-barred into a tight window dictated by the school's curriculum.  I know that time is a factor in all classroom environments, but in my experience, foreign languages are best taught with more time and patience given to the student.  This set really promotes that idea, and manages to have a great deal of social interactivity as well.This program comes with games, live practice sessions, and practical exercises that were actually kind of fun to participate in. I am surprised at the level of immersion a strictly online application is able to achieve. Before I used this product, I felt a set like this would lack social interaction with other native speakers, and learning pronunciations, backgrounds, and some sort of framework as to why a word is pronounced the way it is. A frustrating aspect of any language course at a university is that you are sped (or slowed) along at whatever pace is dictated to your instructor, thus losing some continuity and flow of the learning process. When one is forced to learn a language in a certain time frame it can either cause a lot of stress for those who don't understand concepts, or bore those who feel like they have a good grasp of the material. This set is very useful because you can learn at your own pace, challenge yourself if you feel up to the task, and never get caught in an annoying time schedule. Taking public language courses can be corrupted by rules and regulations, and this set counteracts that notion. Of course, universities have their own versions of online tests and practices, but none are as colorful and vivid as the ones I've experienced in this set. Rosetta Stone has an online community of users that I checked in on several times, and it was filled each time with people waiting to practice and speak with others. The volume of interaction was huge compared to my university experience which is essential in learning a new language.A great deal of production and attention to detail was put into this Rosetta Stone set, and the level of immersion and exercises is not only high, but very enjoyable and interesting. It might be harder to understand how useful this is without ever having taken a university-taught course in language, but I'm now sold. Frankly, I was a little skeptical of how this would work, because learning a new language ultimately needs to be a social experience, and hearing and witnessing native speakers in action is essential in becoming a skilled speaker. However, this set does a fantastic job of capturing that social interaction, and even manages to be a little more exciting in interacting with others via the internet and phone.This is the second foreign language set I've used, and I'm having a good time learning Italian, at my own pace.  It's important that users make a push to learn and to not take too much time in immersing themselves in the concepts with a foreign language, but it's a huge plus to be able to allow oneself to fully grasp an idea before they move on.  Rosetta Stone allows that window to be more flexible, and ultimately clears the way for better and more effective learning.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2011", "summary": "Very impressed!"}

It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program.  The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written.  Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases.  Total immersion, everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer.  Everything is accompanied by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways:  you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy running, boys running).  In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for \"talking to myself\". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD.  The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone.  Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late.  If you're in the Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone. I only checked the price for Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 and as of writing this review, the price is the same as the price on amazon.I am using this program on a PC XP with no problems.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2011", "summary": "Voice Recognition Really Works!"}

Little has changed at the core of the learning system, which is by far and away a good thing.  If you're not familiar with how this program works, it is truly the most \"natural\" way to learn a language.Let me explain (if you do know how this works skip to the next paragraph for updates on the new features).  This program does the best it can to mimic a child-like learning environment, which is what everyone needs to learn.  I really mean it.  Think of it this way: how do children learn a language?  They imitate what they hear and see, right?  They do not have a concept early on of memorization.  Children do not memorize language, grammar, vocabulary, sentences, etc...they repeat what they hear, associate what they hear with what they see, and make mistakes as they go, slowly correcting themselves with guidance and observation and trial and error.  This program does the same thing, but with you, an adult (or so I presume for most readers of this review).  It shows you a picture, associates the word visually, and then through audition.  You then practice back by seeing, choosing, saying the words that you have learned.  You'll make mistakes, but will self-correct with this program just like a child would.  Practice will not make perfect, only permanent.  Hence, when you do practice, make sure to do it slowly and really understand what it is that you're saying, seeing, and hearing; this program makes it much easier than reading a book alone, or just listening to audio cassettes; it's truly an all-encompassing programs.  Memorization and just repetition is NOT the way to learn a language, and friend of mine who did this for 4 years (think Highschool) cannot speak a single sentence even though they were A students.  I, having been blessed with a teacher who forced us to live the language by all the ways that a mind can comprehend it, never memorized the language, and can speak it very well now (no medical terms, but good `ol conversation and banter).So, what's new here compared to V3?  I was pleasantly surprised that at least one of my previous suggestions in a previous review was taken seriously.  I had mentioned the need for you to practice with native speakers in order to really get the hang of a language.  And now, you get this chance with a short free trial.  I had also mentioned in the old review to make learning the language fun, as anything that's fun is instantly remembered for the long term better as we all know.  Rosetta Stone included games to play and enjoy.  I'm very happy that this company really listens to its customers and updates its products, instead of sticking to its guns thinking they figured everything out.  Two thumbs up for that.I HAVE NOT (reason forthcoming), yet tried the online sessions with the native speakers.  There's a reason for this, and I really hope you take note of this before purchasing this product.  First, I don't recommend purchasing level 1 of this language (and logically of any).  I want you to ask yourself why you want to learn this language?  To learn how to say \"pants\" and barely speak or comprehend a sentence, or to actually learn to have some minimal conversational skill?  I'm going to take a wild guess and say you fit into the latter category.  It makes no sense to me to \"try\" out learning a language and barely learn anything for such an EXPENSIVE program!  Unless you have money to burn skip buying the incomplete set, please.  I recommend that if you are REALLY truly serious about getting the hang of a language to a minimally conversational degree with just the software then get the entire set and save yourself money in the long-run (quite a bit I might add).  Then use the online native speakers to help you master your conversational abilities.  BUT, I emphasize, DO NOT waste your money activating your free trial of the native speaker engagement sessions (and games) until you have complete the entire program.  Why in the world would you take precious time and money to do such a thing when you'll just be able to spit back the names of colors and buildings back to one another?  Wait until you get semi-coherent and put your hard earned dollars to work only then, after mastering the program.  This is precisely why I haven't activated the free trial yet, I want to really get the hang of at least the portion of the program I got to review until I speak to a native speaker.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2011", "summary": "New additions in this programs are excellent!"}

The various exercises, capacity for interaction, and games transform what could be tedious into what I'm sure many will find a constant treat.Allowing for that the vocabulary at this level is not new to me, I must say that, since my memory is more visual than audio, and I find studying vocabulary in books to be helpful, I cannot say whether I could have picked up much had I depended only on this method.

Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy.  The only issue I had was getting the included microphone/headset to work right.  It kept telling me to say \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\" into the microphone, but it kept saying it couldn't configure the microphone.  I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine.  In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be done.  I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for just the microphone?  Oh well, no big deal, just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son, and he enjoyed it a great deal too.  He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English.  It was only images and Italian words and speaking.  This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words.  However, it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is high.  However, how much would it cost to take a foreign language class?  The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost.

Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language (and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new language.

You know, they actually do. From my dyslexic sister to my stroke-victim mother, Rosetta Stone meets the challenges of teaching a wide range of people and at a wide range of natural ability.My personal failure to learn a foreign language is legendary. I took years of both high school and college Spanish--can't speak it. I got all the way to intermediate American Sign Language with college courses--can't get past spelling my name. I have failed at Korean, German, and French with equal aplomb. So as someone who has used tapes, CDs, computer programs, traditional school-room methods and real live people willing to teach me, let me say with some authority that Rosetta Stone is not only the best language learning device I have ever seen it is the only way I would ever recommend learning a foreign language outside of parachuting into a foreign country and stumbling around until you figure out what people are trying to tell you (otherwise known as \"total immersion\"). The lessons are challenging without being frustrating, the method is entertaining on a certain level, and the results immediate and noticeable.I like learning and I liked school, so I didn't mind working my way through the program. The real surprise was my little sister. She is severely dyslexic and absolutely hated most of her school life. She took to this like I couldn't believe, coming over to my house just for her \"lessons\" and sitting for hours quietly working through the program. She's rarely shown such devotion to learning and certainly not on her own free time. I also plan to set up an account for my mother, who had a series of strokes a few years back and is on disability. She could never learn a language in a classroom or by a rote memorization method (she can't remember what she did an hour ago) but she could learn this. I have never come across a learning program that works in the face of so many different kinds of obstacles.Weak spots are minor and few. The microphone included with the set doesn't always pick up voice correctly (for the amount they charge they should use a top-quality mike). The \"games\" in the program are tedious and have a thrown-together-at-the-last-moment-feel. I did not use the online functions because I really really detest the current trend of nickel and diming people to death with \"subscriptions\" for every little thing.

Previously, I learned from a few sources, which included an audio CD and several \"Instant Italian\" pocket guides.  Having tried the Rosetta Stone method, I cannot go back to the other ways.  It works.The Rosetta Stone method breaks down and simplifies language learning more intuitively than other programs and methods I've tried.  It does not emphasize grammar rules or vocabulary lists.  Rather, it provides an environment where you learn by associating words with images.  This curriculum follows some of the basic principles in many immersion education programs, and mimics the way language is taught to a small child.  In my opinion and experience, this association method helps to increase retention, and makes learning much more intuitive.This package has a very good speech recognition system integrated into the program.  This helps to improve the learning process, since it gives feedback on accent and pronunciation, and improves your ability to speak as well.What I liked:Interactive software - I was able to apply what I learned after each lesson.It also comes with a headset+microphone to help with the pronounciation.  BIG PLUS!Audio companion - I loaded up these lessons on my MPT3 player and I was able to practice while driving to and from work.Online Lessons - I liked the practice sessions, and having native Italian speakers is a huge plus.I was able to perfect my pronunciation with this set.  There is an online community that you can join and participate with others online.  It's a very nice addition, and something that seems exclusive to Rosetta.  However, this feature is only available without extra cost for 3 months, after this trial period it is $25/month, or $149 for 15 months.  I finished the software lessons, went through it again, and then used the online feature.What I didn't like:My only issue is the price.  It is very expensive!  In some sense, you get what you pay for, and with this you pay a premium.  However, if you want to learn Italian on your own time, and you can afford it, I highly recommend the Rosetta Stone.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2011", "summary": "pricey but excellent way to learn Italian"}

I believe it's the Total-e version, but I'm not sure by how it's worded on this site today (6/28/11).I purchased my copy in August 2010, so I think it may be the previous version. I do not have Total-e.With all that said, I would like to review the software I do have, which I can confirm does match very closely with the description of the software on this page.It is, in a word, EXCELLENT. There are some things about it that are hard to understand, but I honestly don't know how a software program for learning this difficult language could be any better than what Rosetta Stone's (RS) produced.The previous reviewer was complaining that this software is inadequate, because you don't know how to read the script. That is true initially, but leads me to believe that he didn't go very far in the software, because they DO start to teach you to read devanagari within the first unit of level one. It is a fair criticism from the previous reviewer that the foundation they offer is different from what you'd expect. I'm accustomed to learning tourism-friendly phrases first, like to ask where the train station is, etc. RS is NOT like that at all.I knew only the words for some food dishes and for water in Hindi before I started this software, and I could not read a single character in the devanagari syllabary. I was starting from nothing. I have used the Spanish software from RS, and agree that it is to an English speakers definite advantage that Spanish uses the same alphabet we use. However, it is MUCH more complicated to craft a language learning software program in a totally different script. Now that I've spent several months off and on with the program, I appreciate their approach. It would be way too overwhelming to try to learn devanagari first, and then start speaking. 99% of people would quit, because the syllabary is so large and so different from our alphabet.Here is what RS does: They show you pictures, and you hear native speakers talking. You can't read what it says, so you must listen closely. The first unit of level one was tough, I'm not gonna lie. I had to do it a couple of times before I got the hang of it. Then, I just took off. I spent probably 3 or 4 hours with the software on the first day, and by the end of that day, I was able to say \"the girl is eating rice\". Awesome! I think being able to form a simple sentence so quickly helped keep me engaged and confident, which = motivated.True, it does seem to start you off speaking phrases that are not what you commonly find in language learning resources. I'm only a little more than halfway through level one (because I've been going sporadically, have been redoing sections, etc), and I still haven't learned how to say goodbye or thank you. However, I can ask what something is, describe activities that people are doing, say that \"the woman is reading her newspaper,\" \"the man is wearing his coat,\" \"one black cat is under the table,\" and other such phrases that took me MUCH longer to learn using other language learning techniques. I studied Spanish for two years in high school, and never learned how to say these kinds of sentences.They introduce the characters of the devanagari syllabary slowly. I probably know about 20-25 of them by now. As I mentioned earlier, I'm glad they're going slowly, or else I would get frustrated and bored.The real beauty of RS is that you quickly get to the point where the words just roll off your tongue, unlike when you study a language in a classroom setting and get good at taking tests, but end up tongue tied, because you haven't learned how to have a conversation. RS's emphasis on what they call \"dynamic immersion\" is so right on the mark. I cannot say enough good things about their approach to language learning.The software is expensive. But guess what? So are classes, and so is going to another country for an immersion at a language school. If you total up the cost of taking language classes at a community college or going to Mexico or Guatemala to study Spanish (for example), this is BY FAR the best value for your money. Why? Because you can return to it at any time. You can practice in the middle of the night, if you want. If you're shy about making mistakes (like me), it doesn't matter, because you're talking to a computer, and you can always redo a lesson for a better score!If you get this software, one tip I have is to ask for help from a native speaker, if you know anyone. If not, then use their Total-e options. I've needed to ask my boyfriend a few questions, and I'm lucky I have him around as a resource, so I didn't need to get or use Total-e.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2011", "summary": "Best way to learn Hindi short of going to study it in India"}

I learned American Sign Language in a totally natural environment, by contrast, and I feel as at home in ASL as I do in English (my first language). This program feels a lot more like my ASL learning experience than my Spanish experience.I got it to learn as much Greek as possible in about six months, before I go to Greece. I just cracked it open a few days ago, and already I am speaking in full sentences. Granted, they are guided sentences, but I have already pieced together quite a few novel sentences using the vocabulary and grammar I have already picked up. I'm impressed, and I know enough about language learning that being impressed by a piece of software is a pretty big statement for me.Initially I thought I would just learn the absolute basics, enough to survive Greece by myself without an interpreter. But I'm only on level 1, unit 1, lesson 3, and I already see that I am going to learn (and retain) a lot more than survival Greek. I haven't peeked ahead at level two yet, but, judging by how much is packed into the first three lessons, I would guess that each level is superior to an entire semester of a college class, at roughly a third of the price.My only wish so far is that it came with a very basic book of grammar and spelling rules. I do think the program is well-designed, providing careful contrast in each phrase/sentence so that you can figure out the rules as you go, which is the most natural way of doing it.

I purchased the program a few years ago in preparation for a dream trip to Germany.  Within a very short time and with minimal effort on my part, I had more than mastered German, I was speaking it like a native.  I know this because so many people in Germany were shocked to learn I am an American and often refused to believe my accent was not Bavarian.  A few even insisted I was a native German and were adamant I must be joking.  When I told people that I was making my first visit to Germany and was from California, it was not unusual to see a shake of the head accompanied by a hearty laugh.  While there, I had no problem reading train schedules, maps, or even a bit of Goethe when a new German friend recommended him.  I especially enjoyed Wagner when I attended the Bayreuth Opera festival and am very glad indeed that I made that side trip.  Rosetta Stone has broadened my horizons and flung open so many cultural doors that I can not begin to recommend it enough.  Considering my desire to speak and read German simply began with my interest in World War II, it is truly wondrous how much more I have learned there is to German art and culture.  There is certainly more to this beautiful country than militarism and goosestepping parades of troops.  Once one masters the language, entirely new and magnificent vistas come into view.  The subtlety of the tongue introduces you to a warm and loving people who have been deeply misunderstood, often due to communication barriers and semantics.  Rosetta Stone offers the opportunity to all of us to grow closer to one another and to embrace all of humanity through language.  I am currently mastering Japanese and plan to move on to French shortly.  Perhaps the most significant thing I have learned through the wonder that is Rosetta Stone is that there are no limits to what I am capable of learning and to never again turn away from an intellectual challenge.  Even in middle age, it is both easy and fun to learn any new language and to become as fluent as you wish.  Already my Japanese neighbor has asked me how many years I lived in Japan as a child and if I went to school near Kyoto!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2013", "summary": "Incredible"}

The friends I made had a quiz they liked to use: \"What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual;  What do you call a person who speaks two languages?  Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.

I have really enjoyed the lessons and feel like I could at least start to figure out what's going on when we get to France.Pros:-Easy to understand.-Builds on itself nicely.-Repetition to help remember.-Doesn't start at the alphabet & numbers like they do in schools.Cons:-Expensive!-The workbook is 100 pages long and must either be printed or the answers written on paper.-It has occasionally been a little tough to figure out what you're supposed to be doing.-It's not very fond of a light southern accent.-Maybe a little too much repetition for an adult.Ultimately, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn a new language.

This system has given me a new appreciation for the language I was once scared of.The Rosetta Stone TOTALe packaging seemed big, until I opened it up and saw how much was crammed into the box:A nice USB headphone set, with built in microphone and padded ear cups.The actual Rosetta Stone software, for both Mac and PC, and the language specific lessons.Clear stick on labels for your keyboard (to help with the writing portion of the lessons).A CD/mp3 audio companion disc for practicing on the go or in your leisure time.A quick start guide.Authorization card to successfully install and use the software.Warranty information.The initial software install seemed to take a little bit of time, not more than 5 minutes though, but once it was finished the program started right up. The program automatically checked for software updates and gave me the option to download or continue with set up. I decided to download the update and I had to go through an installation for the update, but it went much more quickly than the first. Finally, after the program restarted and I selected the included microphone headset, I was asked to install the language I was working on.After placing the French I disc in and selecting the course, the program prompted that my drive only had space for 3 total courses (French I, II, and III), each at about 600mb. Hard drives are getting cheaper, but I thought it was worth noting that the entire French I course (this set you're looking at) is going to take about 600mb of space; I know that hard drive space can be an issue for some people.I was asked to input the activation code found on a card inside the package. I put the code in and the program connected online to verify it was legitimate.  When the authorization was complete, I was asked to fill out a profile, with my name and date of birth. I was given the option to also take part in the online sessions, which would allow me to practice my new skills with people proficient in the language. I noticed that I was offered a free 3 month trial period. I opted not to sign up for that feature, so I can't comment on its performance. Finally, there was a short introductory video (which I skipped since I'd already watched it online), at that point I was free to start my lessons.I picked the extended reading, writing, and speaking lessons, but there were options for reading and speaking only or reading and writing only, and so on. The core lesson takes you through the basics of the language, doing so only in French. It's full immersion and I was awestruck at how quickly I was picking things up, especially having never studied French. The use of descriptive images and repetitive audio cues, had me speaking a language and knowing what I was saying in matter of minutes. In less than ten minutes I knew several nouns and 3rd person pronouns, both male and female, and their spelling and I had gained the ability to spell and pronounce a number of activities (reading, drinking, eating, running, etc.). It was inspiring to feel successful, especially when half way through the lesson the words disappeared from the screen and I had make the right connections using what I had just learned.When all is said and done, I know I'm not going to be able to move to France and be mistaken as a native because of my excellent pronunciation and conversational skills learned from this program, but as a foundation for further learning and studying, it would be hard to beat this system.

There are tests you can take for each section to see how you are progressing.  This helps you know whether you should repeat a section or proceed.  While the mainstream of the program is immersion, the words are also spelled out for those who like visuals.  It is a carefully thought out and well-designed program.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2010", "summary": "Great program"}

Although the upside of this is that it made me speak more clearly which ultimately is a good thing.I really liked the Totale aspect of this edition. The Totale part is an online companion with games to play that I enjoyed.  Not all of them are blockbusters but there are enough to chose from that I found it to be worthwhile.  My favorite part of Totale was being able to chat with people who actually speak French natively. It's one thing to practice a language and quite another to ACTUALLY try to speak it with someone. I found the people to be very patient and the experience very positive.I'd definitely consider using Rosetta Stone in other languages to prep for trips abroad.

That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2013", "summary": "Suggest getting this 1 level at a time, so you know if you can learn from the program"}

They have nice long straps which you can adjust.I figured out that the least conspicuous way to wear it was to let the straps all the way out, then put it over one shoulder, so that the pouch hung down at about hip level on the opposite side.  Almost like you'd wear a purse or a messenger bag. Then pull up your pants over the stash and put your shirt on and tuck it in over the stash too.That way, it basically sits between your front pocket and your back pocket in the middle of your side, but is completely inaccessible and virtually invisible there.  You have to pull up your shirt out of your pants to get to it, which provides excellent security.  You don't notice it there at all while walking around either.  It is good for your passport and credit cards, but you have to fold cash in half to fit in it, which will make it bulge a bit if you put like $300 or more in $20s in there.  So if you want to carry a lot of cash in this, get large denomination bills.Mine didn't get sweaty or nasty at all, it didn't really bother me at all and we did a LOT of walking around, several miles a day with no issues.  It is not amazingly well made, but is good enough that it should last a good while.My only complaint - I wish the little thing you use to adjust the strap length was a little bit smaller and low profile.

If I had my shirt untucked I had the strap longer in order to access it at my waist. If my shirt was tucked in I had it higher in order to pull it out of the collar for access. The only recommendation I have is to place your items in plastic ziplock bags. You will inevitably sweat while wearing this. The sweat will go through the silk into your items if not covered in plastic. It easily held my money, passports, and other important items.

It has several pockets: making it easy to segregate cash, ID's and charge cards.  It has stood up to the rigors of travel very well - does not seem to stain (with sweat, for instance) easily, and looks as good as new, with no discernible wear.My concerns with the product are as follows:1) The neck cord is incredibly long.  It has an adjuster, but there is an awful lot of &#34;slack&#34; which hangs down my back.  I suppose I could cut the cord to make it shorter, perhaps knotting the ends, but doing so might increase the risk of losing the Stash, so I've not done so.  This is, at most, a minor inconvenience - and it makes sense for the manufacturer to make the cord long, &#34;just in case.&#34;  So, this has not affected my rating of the product.2) My other concern, and this is one that would be true of any such product, is that you cannot wear it under lighter weight fabrics without it showing, which to some extent defeats the purpose of it.  Again, since I think this is a problem you'd see with any such product, it has not affected my rating of it.Overall I am happy with the product.

I thought that was pretty crafty, I used high-quality watercolors to paint the letters and the paint stuck surprisingly well. I'm very happy with this product and if I ever need to send creative and \"puzzling\" messages I'll be sure to buy again. Plus it's a great price!

Sure it's jammed and wieghs a ton when it is that full, but the bag can hold it and hold up to it.  It is soft-sided, so when it isn't jam-packed full it 'feels like a much smaller bag'.It isn't as 'elegant' as some bags, but in my hands it outlasted my Samsonite rolling contractor bag, my Tumi toughbag, and any of several attempts at leather bags.  To me, elegant is being able to carry everything I need without the ultimate loss of elegance -- not having something, or having a bag that self-destructs while I am at a customer's site.The two features I find most helpful are:  1) The laptop compartment faces up, allowing you to pull your laptop out at airport security very conveniently while keeping the bag on your shoulder, and 2) all the exterior pockets are well secured with big zippers and compression straps, to make sure your stuff doesn't sprawl all over the floor when you do eventually accidentally drop it.For someone who is looking for a highly versatile, exceptionally durable laptop or document bag that happens to be availabe at a great price -- this is your bag.After 2 years of abusive service mine looks very rough, one of the metal clips that hold the shoulder strap did break but was easily replaced with a $1.99 caribiner, and one of the zippers is stubborn but functional.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2008", "summary": "Truly a Tough Bag"}

He had originally wanted a $100 mask from another site and there was no WAY I was spending that much.  I knew Amazon would come through for me and they did--in a big way.  This mask was only $16, I got it in 2 days and it is PERFECT.  I can't believe the quality for the price.  The eye holes are a little small as some people mentioned and there is no opening at the mouth but my son doesn't mind and you could always cut it a little bit if you needed too.
